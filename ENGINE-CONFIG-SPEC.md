<!-- AUTO-VENDORED FILE — DO NOT EDIT ----------------------------------------

  Verbatim copy of CONFIG-SPEC.md from budget-lab-chart-engine v1.13.0, the
  engine version pinned in package.json.

  It lives here so that writing a figure never requires opening the engine repo.
  Editing this file is never the right move: figure fields are the engine's to
  define. To change what the engine accepts, repin the engine, then run
  `npm run vendor-spec` and commit the result.

  `npm run validate` fails when this file drifts from the pinned engine.

  rules — see CONFIG-REFERENCE.md.

# Figure config specification

The authoritative list of fields the engine accepts in a figure config. This page mirrors the
contract in `src/spec/` (`types.ts` + `schema.ts`); the schema is strict
(`additionalProperties: false` at every level), so an unknown or mistyped field **fails
validation** rather than being silently ignored. Defaults are applied implicitly — **only declare
what differs**.

Two figure types, one file each:

- **`chart.yaml`** — a `ChartSpec`: line, area, bar, stacked-bar, scatter, dot-plot, waterfall,
  histogram, and dumbbell charts.
- **`table.yaml`** — a `TableSpec`: a formatted, interactive data table.

Validate with `tbl-chart validate <file>` (schema + data cross-reference). Consuming repos
(e.g. budget-lab-charts) add their own collection-level config — `article.yaml` / `tracker.yaml`,
figure-number maps, catalog — which is **not** part of the engine and is documented there.

## `chart.yaml`

### Required

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `chartType` | enum | `line` \| `area` \| `bar` \| `stacked` \| `scatter` \| `dotplot` \| `waterfall` \| `histogram` \| `dumbbell`. |
| `title` | string | Card title above the chart. Rendered verbatim. |
| `xAxisType` | enum | `numeric` \| `temporal` \| `quarterly` \| `categorical`. Determines how the x column is parsed (see [CSV format](#csv-format)). |
| `data` | string \| object | Usually just `data.csv` (see [Data](#data)). |

> There is **no `eyebrow`** field — the figure number is a property of the article a chart is
> embedded in, supplied at embed time (`--eyebrow`), not a spec field.

Axis constraints: `bar` and `stacked` require `xAxisType: categorical`, in both orientations — bars
sit on a band scale, and on a numeric axis that band domain is the numeric domain's two **endpoints**,
so only a chart whose entire x set is those two values (i.e. exactly two rows) draws every bar and
every other shape silently loses the rows in between; a horizontal one draws no bars at all, and a
date axis draws every bar but doubles the x-axis and paints a warning glyph into the figure. All of
it is a validation error rather than a misdraw, including the two-row case that would render
correctly — see [the note below](#why-bar-and-stacked-refuse-a-continuous-axis). For values over
years, ages or percentiles, declare the x values as categories and use `x_order` to fix their order,
or use `chartType: line`. `scatter` requires `xAxisType: numeric`; `dotplot` requires
`xAxisType: categorical`; `histogram` requires `xAxisType: numeric` or `xAxisType: temporal` (a
histogram bins a continuous axis — it has no categorical or quarterly form); `dumbbell` requires
`xAxisType: categorical` (the categorical axis; `orientation` flips it — there is no `yAxisType`);
`waterfall` requires `xAxisType: categorical` **and** is vertical only — `orientation: horizontal`
is a validation error there (the running cumulative reads down the value axis).
[`overlays`](#overlay-lines) additionally requires a non-categorical x-axis and a **vertical**
chart, which together leave it unavailable on `bar` and `stacked`.

### Column mapping

`columns:` maps your CSV column names onto the engine's roles. The whole block is optional; absent,
it defaults to `x: time`, `value: value`, `series: series`.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `columns.x` | string | Column holding the x value. Default `"time"`. |
| `columns.category` | string | Dumbbell only: the categorical-axis column — a synonym for `columns.x` (wins when both are set). |
| `columns.value` | string | Column holding the numeric y value. Default `"value"`. |
| `columns.series` | string | Column identifying series. **Omit for a single-series chart.** Default `"series"` if present. |
| `columns.facet` | string | Column whose distinct values split small-multiples panes. |
| `columns.shape` | string | Point charts only: column driving the marker **shape** (a second encoding channel, independent of color). |
| `columns.point_label` | string | **`scatter` only** (validation rejects it on every other chart type): column naming each OBSERVATION — a year, a state, a firm. It encodes nothing; it is appended verbatim to the hover card's header, after the series and any shape token (`Observed · Compressive · 2004`), so a reader can tell which point they are on. Rendered exactly as the cell holds it — no number or date formatting, and `tooltip_decimals` does not apply. A blank cell contributes no token. There is deliberately no `point_labels` display map: the cell already IS the label. Pointing it at the **series** or **shape** column is collapsed to nothing rather than repeating a token the header already carries. Hover-only, like every tooltip field — a PNG export has no hover state, so the label does not appear in a download. |
| `columns.section` | string | Horizontal bar charts only: column grouping categories into labeled **sections** along the category axis (e.g. Durable goods / Nondurable goods / Services). See [Section axis](#section-axis-horizontal-bars). |
| `columns.x0` / `columns.x1` | string | Histograms only: columns holding each row's bin **lower**/**upper** edge, for **pre-binned** input. Map both to switch the histogram to pre-binned mode; mapping only one is a validation error. See [Histogram](#histogram-options). |

### Text

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `subtitle` | string | Below the title (conventionally naming the units). **Display text only** — it does not affect number formatting; use `value_prefix`/`value_suffix` for that. |
| `source` | string | Source line below the chart. Supports inline links: `[text](url)` renders the text as a link on screen. **The URL needs an explicit `http://`, `https://` or `mailto:` scheme** — anything else (including a bare `www.` or a relative path) is not a link and renders as the literal characters you typed, silently. Nothing else from Markdown is supported, there is no escape syntax, and any incomplete construct is literal text, so existing lines are untouched. A URL longer than 2048 characters is not a link either — the parser stops looking there, which is what keeps a malformed line from being expensive to parse. In a **PNG export** the link text is underlined but not clickable and the URL is not shown — a raster image cannot carry a link target. |
| `note` | string | Note line below the chart, above the source. Supports inline links: `[text](url)` renders the text as a link on screen. **The URL needs an explicit `http://`, `https://` or `mailto:` scheme** — anything else (including a bare `www.` or a relative path) is not a link and renders as the literal characters you typed, silently. Nothing else from Markdown is supported, there is no escape syntax, and any incomplete construct is literal text, so existing lines are untouched. A URL longer than 2048 characters is not a link either — the parser stops looking there, which is what keeps a malformed line from being expensive to parse. In a **PNG export** the link text is underlined but not clickable and the URL is not shown — a raster image cannot carry a link target. |
| `x_axis_title` | string | Caption below the x-axis. |
| `y_axis_title` | string | Short caption above the y-axis (left-aligned, horizontal). |
| `tooltip_decimals` | integer | Decimal places for every hover **value**, independent of the axis ticks — the tooltip card where one is drawn, and the coordinated cursor's value pills where those replace it, so a multi-pane figure honours it too. Default 2. |
| `tooltip_series_name` | boolean | **`scatter` only** (validation rejects it elsewhere): set `false` to drop the **series token** from the hover card's header, leaving the shape and `columns.point_label` tokens — so `Observed · 2004` reads `2004`. Use it where the series exists to colour the marks and `point_label` already says which observation the reader is on. Rejected on other chart types because their cards use the series name as a ROW label against a value: suppressing it there would leave a list of unlabelled numbers, which is a different thing entirely. Pairs with `series_legend` but is independent of it — either surface can name the series without the other. Default true. |
| `tooltip_x_format` | string | d3 `timeFormat` pattern for the tooltip's **x** value. `xAxisType: temporal` or `quarterly` only — rejected on `numeric`/`categorical`. Default (absent): `"%b %Y"` on temporal, `YYYYQ#` on quarterly, matching the axis ticks. Set it when the data is finer than the ticks: on a **daily** series every point in a month otherwise shares one tooltip label, so hovering cannot tell you which day you are on. `"%b %-d, %Y"` → `Jul 23, 2026`. **Faceted figures too:** a multi-pane figure's coordinated cursor replaces each pane's card, and its x echo is drawn with this pattern on one line, on the hovered pane. It is drawn there even where the pane has no x-axis tick to annotate — a temporal axis ticks on whole months, so a **daily** multi-pane line draws none, and the echo is anchored just below the plot instead. Where there ARE tick rows the echo sits on them, and since your format can be wider than the tick it lands on, the tick labels its pill covers are hidden for as long as it shows and restored when the cursor leaves — ticks the pill does not reach stay put, so the axis keeps its context. Absent the field that echo keeps its axis-matching form instead: `%b` over `%Y`, one line per tick row, and nothing at all on a sub-month span, since there is no tick row to mirror. `test/hover-claims-defaults.test.ts` gates all four cases at default settings. |

### Value units

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `value_prefix` | string | Text placed **before** every rendered value — axis ticks, value labels, tooltips. Concatenated literally, so include any space you want (`"$"` vs `"USD "`). On a negative value it sits **after** the minus sign: `-$5`. |
| `value_suffix` | string | Text placed **after** every rendered value. Concatenated literally, so include any leading space you want (`" pp"`, `" billion"`); `"%"` normally wants none. |

```yaml
subtitle: Percentage points     # prose; read by nothing
value_suffix: " pp"             # -> axis "2 pp", tooltip "2.00 pp"
```

```yaml
value_prefix: "$"
value_suffix: " billion"        # -> "$1200 billion", "-$40 billion"
```

No spacing is inserted for you, because `%` wants none and ` pp` does — only the author knows which.

**Precedence.** A narrower explicitly-set format still wins locally: a per-annotation
`value_format` (on an `annotations.xAxis`/`yAxis`/`points` marker) formats that annotation's
`{value}`, and a dumbbell's `gap_annotation.format` — else its chart-level `value_format` — formats
the gap label. Everything else uses `value_prefix`/`value_suffix`.

> **Changed in 1.8.0.** Units used to be **guessed from the subtitle** by substring-matching
> `"percent"`. That put `%` on percentage-*point* charts (a 2 pp change rendered as `2%`) and on any
> subtitle merely containing those letters, e.g. `"Percentiles"`. The inference is gone: a chart that
> wants a `%` must now say `value_suffix: "%"`.

### Inline title selector

An interactive button+popover widget embedded inline in the title, bound to a `{key}` token —
e.g. `title: "GDP by {dimension}"` with a `dimension` entry in `title_selectors`. Every key in
`title_selectors` must appear as `{key}` in `title` (validated). Absent/empty `title_selectors` ⇒
the title renders as plain text, byte-identical to before this field existed. The widget (a boxed
piece of title text with a caret, opening a listbox popover on click) is ported verbatim from the
AI Labor Market Tracker's inline industry picker — click/click-away/Escape/Enter/arrow-keys/type-
ahead all behave the same.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title_selectors` | object | `{ <key>: { options: [{id, label?, color?}, ...], default? } }`. `label` defaults to `id`. `default` must be one of `options[].id`; falls back to the first option when omitted. |

Changing the selection updates the trigger label in place (no rebuild of the header) and fires a
bubbling `tbl-title-select` CustomEvent (`detail: { id, value }`). `MountOptions.selections` sets
the initial selections (per-key: a valid id wins, else the selector's `default`, else its first
option); `MountOptions.onSelect` is called on every change. PNG export renders the title with
whichever option is currently active (or the initial `selections`, for a scripted export).

**Color matching.** An option's trigger label is tinted to its resolved color: an explicit
`option.color` wins; else `series_colors[option.label ?? option.id]` (the chart's own per-series
color map); else the label inherits the surrounding title color, unchanged. On a **single-series**
chart, the active option's resolved color is also fed back as an accent onto the rendered line
itself — selecting a different option re-colors the chart to match, and a PNG export downloaded
with that selection matches what was on screen (AILMT parity: the by-industry picker recoloring
its own line). On a **multi-series** chart this accent is not applied — only the trigger label
tints; each series keeps its own distinct color from the palette/`series_colors`.

### Axes

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `xAxisPolicy.anchorAtZero` | boolean | Numeric x-axis only: extend the visible domain to include 0. **Default `false`** (the axis fits its data range — anchoring at zero squishes a year axis to the right). |
| `x_order` | array | Categorical x-axis only: render order for the x-axis categories. Listed categories come first in this order; any unlisted ones follow in data-encounter order. **Order-only** — unlike `series_order`, it does *not* filter. Ignored off a categorical x-axis. |
| `x_labels` | object | Categorical x-axis: `{ <category>: "Display label" }` for the hover-tooltip header (lets the tooltip read more verbosely than the compact axis ticks). **It heads every hover CARD, and only a card** — so check which surface your chart hovers with. Cards that carry it: `dumbbell`, `dotplot` and categorical-x `line` (standalone, and faceted wherever the card survives coordination — a dumbbell always does), and the *band* card, drawn at default settings on a **stacked** bar with a net dot (a stack with a negative value) or under an explicit `barStack.hover: "tooltip"`. Where a chart draws no card there is no header to put it in: plain/grouped `bar` and `waterfall` hover with value pills in every configuration, and a coordinated small-multiples pane replaces its card with the in-place cursor. That cursor's own category echo stays the **raw** category by design — it overlays the rendered axis tick, taking that tick's box, wrapping and rotation, and this field exists to read more verbosely than the tick. `test/hover-claims-defaults.test.ts` gates every case above at default settings. |
| `yAxisPolicy.min` | number | Hard floor for the y-axis. |
| `yAxisPolicy.max` | number | Hard ceiling for the y-axis. |
| `yAxisPolicy.includeZero` | boolean | When `true` (and no hard min/max), always extend the y-domain to 0. |
| `yAxisPolicy.tickCount` | integer | Approximate target number of y-ticks. Default 5. |
| `yAxisPolicy.autoWiden.step` | number | When data exceeds `max`, round the ceiling up to the next multiple of `step`. |

**Truncating the axis below the data.** When `min`/`max` cut into the data, **every chart type**
clips its marks to the plot frame: the geometry runs to its true crossing with the axis edge and
stops there. Nothing is dropped or clamped, so the shape resumes at the correct x when a series
re-enters the range — do *not* pre-clip the source data (that either fakes a plateau or reads as
missing data, and the chart's CSV download would ship the altered values). Value labels, gap
annotations and reference lines are deliberately **not** clipped: a half-cut label reads worse than
one sitting past the axis.

Note that `min`/`max` are **nice'd outward** to land on clean tick boundaries, so the rendered
ceiling can sit above the number you wrote (`max: 15` with 5 ticks renders a 20 ceiling) — clipping
only engages once the *nice'd* domain still cuts the data.

A line leaving the frame is honest but easy to misread as the end of the series, so pair a truncated
axis with a note or an `annotations.yAxis` marker at the ceiling.

**Reversing the axis.** Set `min` **greater than** `max` to flip the value axis, so the numerically
lower value sits at the top: `yAxisPolicy: { min: 0.0, max: -3.0 }` puts `-3.0` at the ceiling and
`0.0` at the floor. Use it for indices where more-negative is worse (CFNAI, output gaps) and the
conventional reading is "down is bad, so draw it up."

Reversal works on **every chart type**, and on the value axis wherever it lives. `min` is the axis'
NEAR edge — the bottom on a vertical chart, the left on a horizontal one — and `max` is the far edge,
so reversing moves the numerically lower value to the top (vertical) or the right (horizontal). On
horizontal bars that means negative data grows left-to-right from a zero line at the left, the mirror
of its ascending layout. Both bounds must be pinned: `min` alone, or `max` alone, is read as
ascending.

A reversed axis is a scale flip and nothing more, so the rest of the engine follows it:

| | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Ticks and gridlines | Run top-to-bottom in descending order. |
| Zero baseline | Still drawn whenever the domain straddles zero. |
| `shading` baselines | Close on their threshold, not on the frame edge. |
| Reference markers, `annotations.points` | Fold in without moving either pinned bound. |
| Clipping | Engages only on real overflow, in either direction. |
| Value labels | Stay clear of the mark's end, on whichever pixel side that now is. |
| `autoWiden` | Extends whichever end the data overflows — on a reversed axis that is `max`, the numeric floor. |
| Small multiples | The one shared domain stays reversed across every pane. |
| Bars, stacks, histograms, waterfalls | Still grow from zero; on a reversed all-positive domain they hang from the ceiling. |

### Series

The series **column** is set via `columns.series`. These options reference the series **keys**
(the values in that column).

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `series_order` | array | Render order. **Also an inclusion filter** — when set, only listed series render. For stacked charts (bar/area) it is also the bottom→top stack order. |
| `series_colors` | object | `{ <seriesKey>: color }`. Overrides palette assignment. `color` is a named color or raw `"#hex"` (see [Colors](#colors)). |
| `series_patterns` | object | `{ <seriesKey>: hatch }` — a **texture** for the series' fill, alongside its color. Filled chart types only (`bar`, `stacked`, `area`, `histogram`, `waterfall`); rejected elsewhere. See [Series textures](#series-textures). |
| `series_styles` | object | `{ <seriesKey>: { dashed: true } }`. `dashed` is currently the only flag. |
| `series_labels` | object | `{ <seriesKey>: "Display name" }`. Lets the CSV use short keys while the legend/tooltip show full names. |
| `bar_color` | color | **Single-series bar charts only.** The one series' bar fill, resolved through the palette. A first-class replacement for the `series_colors: {"": color}` idiom — that idiom still works; `bar_color` wins when both are set. Ignored on multi-series (grouped) bar charts. With `highlightSeries`, `bar_color` replaces the base color only — a non-highlighted series still dims. |
| `category_colors` | object | **Single-series bar charts only** (both orientations). `{ <xCategory>: color }` — per-category fill override, e.g. a distinct color for one "Total" category while the rest keep the base fill (`bar_color` or series color). Unlisted categories are unaffected. Ignored on multi-series (grouped) bar charts. Validation flags any key not found in the x column. |

### Annotations

A single `annotations:` block holds all four annotation kinds. (The legacy `xAxisPolicy.markers`,
`xAxisPolicy.bands`, and `yAxisPolicy.markers` fields are still accepted and mean the same as
`annotations.xAxis`, `annotations.bands`, and `annotations.yAxis` respectively — prefer
`annotations`.)

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `annotations.xAxis` | array | **Vertical** reference lines. Each `{x, label?, value_format?, style?, color?, strokeWidth?, labelSide?, labelPosition?, labelDx?, labelDy?, facet?}`; `x` required. `style` is `dashed` (default) \| `solid`. Two label controls: **`labelSide`** = which *side of the line* (`left`\|`middle`\|`right`, default right); **`labelPosition`** = *where along the line* relative to the x-axis (`top` default, auto-staggered \| `middle` \| `bottom`). `labelDx`/`labelDy` are px nudges — **`+labelDx` = right, `+labelDy` = up**. On **horizontal bar** charts with a numeric `x`, an `xAxis` marker now renders as a vertical rule on the value axis (previously silently ignored). |
| `annotations.yAxis` | array | **Horizontal** reference lines. Each `{y, label?, value_format?, style?, color?, strokeWidth?, labelSide?, labelPosition?, labelDx?, labelDy?, facet?}`; `y` required. Two label controls (the axes swap vs. xAxis): **`labelSide`** = which *side of the line* (`top` default \| `middle` \| `bottom`); **`labelPosition`** = *where along the line* (`left` \| `middle` \| `right`, default right). `labelDx`/`labelDy` are px nudges — **`+labelDx` = right, `+labelDy` = up**. |
| `annotations.bands` | array | **Shaded** vertical x-regions. Each `{start, end, label?, color?, legend?, rug?}`. |
| `annotations.points` | array | **Callouts** at a data coordinate. Each `{x, label, y?, series?, value_format?, color?, dx?, dy?, connector?}`; `x` + `label` required. Omit `y` and give `series` to snap to that series' value at `x` (the cumulative stack top on area charts). `connector: true` draws a leader arrow from the label to the point. `dx`/`dy` nudge the label — **`+dx` = right, `+dy` = up**. |

Marker/label `color` is a named color or `"#hex"`; the label color matches its line. When
`color` is omitted, both `xAxis` and `yAxis` reference lines default to the dim annotation
neutral (`annotationDim`) so they read as chrome rather than a data series.

**`{value}` token.** Any `xAxis`/`yAxis`/`points` `label` may contain a literal `{value}` token,
substituted with the marker's own numeric value (`x` when it parses as a number, `y`, or the
callout's resolved value). `value_format` controls the substitution: `{decimals?, prefix?, suffix?}`
(decimals default 2). Without `value_format`, the substitution falls back to the chart's
value-axis tick format (`yAxis`/`points`) or the raw `x` string (`xAxis`, or any `x` that doesn't
parse as a number). A `label` without the token is unaffected.

**`facet` (small multiples only).** Scope an `xAxis`/`yAxis` marker to the pane whose facet value
equals `facet`; omit to render in every pane (unchanged default). Ignored on a non-faceted chart.
`bands`/`points` are not facet-scoped.

### Keying annotations in the legend (`legend: true`)

On a busy chart there is often nowhere inside the frame for an annotation's label to sit. Set
`legend: true` on a `bands`, `xAxis`, or `yAxis` entry (or on a [`shading`](#shading-line-charts)
region) and its `label` renders as a **legend row** above the plot instead of as text inside it.

| behavior | detail |
|---|---|
| needs a `label` | The label *is* the legend key. `legend: true` with no label is a validation error. |
| **replaces** the in-chart label | A keyed band or reference line draws no text in the frame and reserves no auto-stagger row. Moving the label out is the point; asking for both would re-create the clutter. |
| one row per **label** | Entries sharing a label collapse into a single row — three recession bands become one "US recessions" key. (A fill and a reference line sharing a label stay separate rows: one swatch can't be both.) |
| swatch | Fills get a rect chip in the tint you will actually see (the fill color flattened over white at its `fillOpacity`, with a hairline so a 10 %-opaque band still reads as a chip). Reference lines get a line swatch in the marker's color, dashed when the marker is. A `rug: true` entry is keyed by its **solid** rug color instead — the block, not the tint, is what the reader matches. An [`overlays`](#overlay-lines) line is keyed by the same rule — its own color, dashed when it is — and falls back to the annotation neutral only where its one row stands for lines of **several** colors, which a single line swatch cannot carry. |
| **multi-series fills** | A `shading` region with no `series` paints one fill per series, each in that series' color. Its chip then shows **every** tint as equal bands (widening so the bands stay legible, up to 30 px), rather than keying the gold and purple fills with the blue one. Writing one region per series under a shared label collapses to that same single banded row. Give the region an explicit `color` to key it with one chip instead. |
| **`rug: true` keys the block** | A rug-flagged fill's chip is a single **solid** chip in the block's own color — the strip can draw only one color, and the chip's job there is to key the block. That color is the region's `color`, else the color of the `series` it names, else the annotation neutral (a region covering *every* series has no one color a strip could carry). |
| ambiguous swatches rejected | Two keyed fills that would resolve to the **same** swatch — both taking their tint from the series palette, over the same series scope, at the same `fillOpacity` — are a validation error. This bites the natural above-target / below-target pair: give at least one an explicit `color` (or a different `fillOpacity`). |
| row order | Series → `bands` → `shading` → `xAxis` → `yAxis` → explicit `rug.tracks`, each in spec order. Not author-controllable. |
| `legend: false` | Suppresses the row (including one implied by `rug: true`). Chart-level `legend: false` suppresses the whole legend, in which case a keyed label stays in the frame rather than being lost. |

**Hover and pin.** Keyed rows are interactive, in both directions:

- **Hovering a row** brightens every chart element it names — all its bands, all its fills, its
  reference line, all its rug blocks — and dims everything else **the legend could have selected**:
  the data line included, the other rows' elements, and a per-series [overlay](#overlay-lines) fit.
  Clicking pins that highlight; a reset button appears beside the legend to clear it.
- Chrome that is in **neither** universe — no legend row of its own and no series — stays at full
  strength: an unkeyed reference line, and an [`overlays`](#overlay-lines) line that is neither keyed
  nor per-series (a pooled `by: none` fit, a `fun`, a `slope`/`intercept` line). Such a line names
  nothing the reader could have picked, so dimming it would report only that they picked something
  else. Each `overlays` entry is judged on its own, so mixing the two kinds in one list is fine, and
  a keyed overlay's confidence ribbon always behaves exactly as its own line does.
- **Hovering a rug block** does the reverse: it marks its legend row and brightens that track's other
  parts, dimming the rest. Clicking pins it. While the pointer is on the strip the value crosshair
  stands down, so a rug hover gives one answer rather than two.
- Selecting a **series** row dims the keyed annotations too — the two live in one universe, so any
  selection spotlights its own subject.
- A keyed `shading` fill answers to **both** keys: it dims with its own line (as it always has) and
  lights up with its annotation row.

In-frame regions — band rects and `shading` fills — are deliberately **not** hover targets. They sit
where the reader sweeps the crosshair to read values, so hovering them would flicker the whole chart
on and off as the pointer crossed each region. The rug is the hoverable key.

A chart with **one** series and keyed annotations gets a legend built from those rows alone — which
is the case the feature was built for. `annotations.points` cannot be keyed: a callout *is* its
label, and moving it loses the coordinate it points at.

```yaml
annotations:
  bands:
    - { start: "2008-01-01", end: "2009-07-01", color: grey, label: US recessions, legend: true }
    - { start: "2020-03-01", end: "2020-05-01", color: grey, label: US recessions, legend: true }
  yAxis:
    - { y: 0.29, label: "Threshold (0.29)", color: grey, legend: true }
```

### X-axis rug

`rug` draws a thin strip of **solid interval blocks** between the x-axis line and its tick labels —
a timeline for categories that are illegible as fills (a one-month false-positive run on a 26-year
axis is a hairline) or that would clutter the frame as labelled bands.

Blocks are grouped into **tracks**, one per label and color. All tracks paint into the **one** strip
in resolution order (later over earlier), so the strip reads as a single timeline rather than a stack
of rows. Every track is keyed in the legend.

Tracks are usually **derived, not declared**: flag an `annotations.bands` or `shading` entry with
`rug: true` and its interval joins the track named by its `label`. That keeps the dates stated once.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rug` | object | `{height?, tracks?}`. Both optional — `rug: {}` is valid and correct when every track is derived from a `rug: true` flag. |
| `rug.height` | number | Height in px of **one row**. **Default 8.** The tick labels shift down to make room for the whole strip, so nothing overlaps. |
| `rug.rows` | enum | `single` (default) \| `per-track`. **`single`** paints every track into one row, later over earlier. **Know what that costs:** where tracks overlap, the later one *covers* the head of the earlier one, so the earlier block is drawn shorter than its true span — on the michez-rule chart the recession blocks lose 17–51 % that way, and the strip reads as gold-*then*-grey when the false negative actually sits *inside* the recession's first months. Choose `single` when the compactness is worth that, and **`per-track`** — a row per track, where nothing can hide anything and every block shows its true extent — when the extents carry the meaning, or for per-series breach windows. A track that `single` would cover *completely* is a validation error naming this field; partial cover is legal and unflagged, because no threshold separates it from the michez read (that chart's worst block is 51 % covered, more than a visibly-degraded multi-series strip at 50 %). |
| `rug.tracks` | array | Standalone tracks, for a timeline concept with no band or fill of its own. Each `{label, intervals, color?, legend?}`. Appended after the derived tracks. |
| `rug.tracks[].intervals` | array | Each `{from, to}` — closed x-value spans in the same string form as `annotations.bands.start`/`end` (**quote numbers in YAML**). Must not be empty. |
| `rug.tracks[].color` | color | Named token or `"#hex"`, painted **solid**. Default: the dim annotation neutral. |
| `rug.tracks[].legend` | boolean | Set `false` to draw the blocks without a legend row. Rare — you then have to key them some other way. |
| `annotations.bands[].rug` | boolean | Add this band's `start`→`end` to the rug. Needs a `label`. |
| `shading[].rug` | boolean | Add this region's `from`→`to` to the rug. Needs a `label` **and both bounds** — an open-ended fill has no interval to draw. |

`rug: true` implies `legend: true` (a solid block with no key is unreadable); `legend: false` on the
same entry opts the row back out.

A block narrower than 2px is drawn at 2px, so a single month stays visible — that being the whole
point. Blocks are clamped to the plot's x extent; an interval wholly outside the x-domain is dropped.

**Not supported:** `xAxisType: categorical` (a band scale has no position between categories) and
`small_multiples`. Both are validation errors, as is a `rug` that resolves to no tracks.

A `rug: true` band still paints its in-chart tint. To show a concept **only** on the rug, declare it
as an explicit `rug.tracks` entry instead of as a band.

**Multi-series charts.** One strip is a single timeline, so it cannot say *which series* is in a given
state — a region covering every series draws one neutral track ("some series is below balance here").
For per-series timelines, give each region its own `series` and `label` and set `rug.rows: per-track`:
each series then gets its own row, in its own color, and the rows read as a small gantt.

**Don't make one row key two different things.** `rug: true` on a region covering every series asks a
single row to key both N colored fills *and* one neutral block, and it can only do one — it keys the
block (see the table above), leaving the fills identified by the series rows instead. When you want
both keyed, they are two concepts, so give them two rows: leave the fill un-rugged (its chip bands the
tints) and declare the union band as its own `rug.tracks` entry with its own label.

```yaml
# The fills, keyed by their own tints…
shading:
  - { side: negative, label: Below balance, legend: true, fillOpacity: 0.35 }
# …and the union band, keyed as the separate thing it is.
rug:
  tracks:
    - { label: Any series below, color: grey, intervals: [{ from: "2000", to: "2030" }] }
```

```yaml
# The michez-rule chart: recessions from the bands, false negatives/positives from the fills.
rug: {}
annotations:
  bands:
    - { start: "2001-04-01", end: "2001-12-01", color: grey, label: US recessions, rug: true }
    - { start: "2008-01-01", end: "2009-07-01", color: grey, label: US recessions, rug: true }
  yAxis:
    - { y: 0.29, label: "Threshold (0.29)", color: grey, legend: true }
shading:
  - { from: "2001-04-01", to: "2001-07-01", side: negative, baseline: 0.29, color: amber, label: False negatives, rug: true }
  - { from: "2008-01-01", to: "2008-04-01", side: negative, baseline: 0.29, color: amber, label: False negatives, rug: true }
  - { from: "2024-03-01", to: "2025-06-01", side: positive, baseline: 0.29, color: red, label: False positives, rug: true }
```

### Confidence bands

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `confidence_bands` | array | Each `{series, lower, upper}`. `series` is the data key the band wraps; `lower`/`upper` are CSV column names. Renders as a tinted area behind the line. |

### Shading (line charts)

`shading` fills the region between a line and its baseline. **`chartType: line` only** — `area`
already fills to the axis, and the other types have no line to fill under.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `shading` | array | Each `{series?, side?, from?, to?, color?, fillOpacity?, label?, legend?, rug?}`. Entries are **independent** and paint in list order, so one series may carry several regions; overlapping fills compound their opacity (that is how you deepen a tint). |
| `shading[].series` | string | Series to fill under. **Omitted → every in-scope series** gets its own region in its own color. |
| `shading[].baseline` | number | The level the fill runs to, and what `side` is measured against. **Default 0.** Set it to a rule's threshold to shade only the breach — the part of the line beyond that level, filled back to it. Negative thresholds work the same way (`baseline: -0.7` with `side: negative`). |
| `shading[].side` | string | `both` (default) \| `positive` \| `negative` — which side of `baseline` to fill. Runs are split at the baseline crossing, interpolated so the fill closes flat on it rather than on a slanted edge. |
| `shading[].from` / `.to` | string | Inclusive x bounds, same string form as `annotations.bands.start`/`end` — **quote numbers in YAML** (`from: "2026"`), exactly as `annotations` x values require. Omitted → the series' first/last point. A bound falling **between** two points is interpolated to that exact x, so the fill edge lands where you asked rather than at the nearest point. On a categorical x-axis there is no position between categories, so bounds must **name existing categories** and crop on category boundaries. |
| `shading[].color` | color | Named palette token or `"#hex"`. Omitted → the series' own resolved color. |
| `shading[].fillOpacity` | number | 0–1. **Default `0.5`.** Two overlapping regions compound — 0.5 over 0.5 renders as 0.75 — so drop the lower one if you are layering a base tint under an accent window. |
| `shading[].label` | string | What the fill **means** ("False positives"). A fill has no in-chart text of its own, so this is purely a key: it names the region in the legend (with `legend: true`) and groups regions into one [rug](#x-axis-rug) track. Regions sharing a label collapse to one legend row. **Requires `legend: true` or `rug: true`** — a label with neither has nothing to do, so validation rejects it. |
| `shading[].legend` | boolean | Key this fill in the legend — see [Keying annotations in the legend](#keying-annotations-in-the-legend-legend-true). |
| `shading[].rug` | boolean | Also draw this region's span as a solid block on the [x-axis rug](#x-axis-rug). Needs a `label` and **both** `from` and `to`. |

**Baseline.** `baseline` (default 0) is what `side` measures against and where the fill's flat edge
sits. The drawn edge is clamped into the resolved y-domain, so a fill never leaves the plot frame. Shading does **not** expand the domain: if you want the zero
baseline actually visible on a chart whose data sits well away from it, set
`yAxisPolicy.includeZero: true`. `side` always keys off zero, never off that clamped baseline.

Fills paint in the underlay — behind the gridlines, and beneath any `confidence_bands` on the same
chart. They carry their series' identity, so legend hover/pin dims them with their line.

Validation rejects a region naming a series the data lacks, a categorical bound naming a missing
category, and a `side` that could never match (e.g. `side: negative` where the series is never
negative).

```yaml
# Shade only where a rule is breached, filling back to its threshold rather than to zero.
chartType: line
shading:
  - series: Sahm rule
    side: positive
    baseline: 0.5
annotations:
  yAxis:
    - { y: 0.5, label: "Threshold (0.5)", color: grey }   # draw the threshold line itself
```

```yaml
chartType: line
shading:
  - series: Primary deficit
    side: negative              # shade only the deficit years
  - series: Primary deficit
    from: "2026"                # a flatter tint over the projection window
    to: "2035"
    color: gray
    fillOpacity: 0.10
```

### Overlay lines

`overlays` draws lines over the data marks. Each entry declares **exactly one** of four kinds —
`method` (a least-squares fit of the plotted data), `fun` (an equation in x), `slope`+`intercept` (a
stated line), or `column` (a value already in the data) — plus shared styling and keying. Entries paint
in list order.

**Numeric and temporal x only.** A categorical band scale has no position between categories, so
`overlays` is a validation error there — the same restriction the [x-axis rug](#x-axis-rug) has. On a
temporal axis, `fun`, `slope`+`intercept` and an explicit numeric `domain` are also rejected: x would be
epoch milliseconds and the coefficients would not mean anything. Use `method` or `column` there.

**Vertical charts only — so not on `bar` or `stacked` at all.** An overlay's values are drawn against
the **y** axis, so a chart whose value axis is x has nowhere to put them: `overlays` with
`orientation: horizontal` is a validation error on `bar` and `stacked`, the chart types that act on
`orientation`. Those two are unavailable in *either* orientation, because they also require
`xAxisType: categorical` and a categorical axis is rejected above — a bar or stacked chart cannot
carry an overlay. `dumbbell` — horizontal by default — is likewise excluded by its categorical x.
On `line`, `area` and `scatter`, `orientation` has no effect at all, so it neither changes the chart
nor the overlay there.

**On a histogram, `fun` and `slope`+`intercept` only.** `method` and `column` are validation errors
there: histogram rows carry bin edges rather than a per-row x, so there is nothing to fit and no column
to read. `fun` is the path for a density curve — see the `dnorm` note below.

For a **horizontal or vertical rule**, use `annotations.yAxis` / `annotations.xAxis` — not `slope: 0`.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `overlays[].method` | enum | `lm` (a straight fit — Stata `lfit`, R `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`) \| `poly` (a polynomial — Stata `qfit` at degree 2). **Bivariate:** y is fitted against the plotted x and nothing else. A multi-predictor model belongs upstream; bring its coefficients in through `fun` + `params`, or its fitted values through `column`. `loess`/`lowess` is not implemented — precompute one and use `column`. Not supported on `chartType: histogram`. |
| `overlays[].degree` | integer | `method: poly` only. 2–5, default 2. |
| `overlays[].fun` | string | An expression in `x`, sampled over `domain` — Stata `twoway function`, R `geom_function`. See the grammar below. |
| `overlays[].params` | object | `fun` only. `{ name: number }` constants substituted into the expression — the readable way to carry coefficients computed elsewhere instead of inlining floats. R's `stat_function(args = )`. |
| `overlays[].n` | integer | `fun` only. Sample count across `domain`. 2–2000, default 100. |
| `overlays[].slope` / `.intercept` | number | A line stated rather than fitted (R `geom_abline`). **Both required together.** |
| `overlays[].column` | string | A data column holding a precomputed value per row, drawn as a line. **This is the one kind that affects the value axis** — see the note below. A blank cell is treated as absent, not as zero, so a sparse column breaks its line rather than diving to the baseline. A cell that is neither blank nor a number is a validation error — the renderer would drop that vertex and reroute the line between its neighbours, which reads as a plausible wrong line rather than a gap. Not supported on `chartType: histogram`. |
| `overlays[].by` | enum | `method`/`column` only. `series` (default) fits one line per colour series; `none` pools every in-scope point into one. **`none` on a `column` that varies by series draws a sawtooth, and nothing rejects it.** The pooled polyline takes every in-scope row's value at each x, x-sorted, with no dedupe — so on a multi-series chart it visits each series' value in turn and zig-zags between them. Pool a column only when it genuinely holds one value per x (replicated across each series' row); otherwise leave `by` at its default. Validation used to try to catch this and was withdrawn in 1.12.0: the check has to know which rows are *drawn* — and that set is narrowed by `domain`, `facet`, `series_order` and `small_multiples.pane_order`, so re-deriving it produced false rejections of figures that render correctly. The sawtooth is self-evident on the rendered chart. |
| `overlays[].ci` | number | `method` only. Confidence level in (0, 1) (e.g. `0.95`) for a tinted ribbon around the fit — the interval on the **fitted mean** (R's `interval = "confidence"`, Stata's `lfitci`), not a prediction interval. Omitted ⇒ no ribbon. A fit with no residual degrees of freedom (n ≤ degree + 1) draws its line and no band. The ribbon paints **behind** the data marks at the same opacity as `confidence_bands`, so a dense scatter stays readable through it. |
| `overlays[].domain` | `axis` \| `[min, max]` | The x extent the line is drawn over. **`axis`** spans the resolved x-domain — say this rather than hardcoding bounds, which silently stop spanning the frame when the data move. **`[min, max]`** states it explicitly (numeric x only, min < max). Omitted ⇒ the extent of the group's **observations** for `method`/`column` (matching Stata `lfit`'s own default, which stops at the data), the resolved x-domain for `fun` and `slope`+`intercept`. A row whose value cell is blank is not an observation — a `method` fit skips it, so the line stops at the last point actually fitted rather than reaching out to a gap in the data. **An overlay never widens the x axis, and no field currently does** — `xAxisPolicy` carries only `anchorAtZero` (extend the domain to include 0); there is no x counterpart to `yAxisPolicy.min`/`.max`. So a `[min, max]` reaching past the data extent is **clipped** rather than expanding the frame, and a Stata `range()` that widens the plot has no equivalent here. |
| `overlays[].label` | string | What the line means. Drawn in-frame anchored at a point **on** the line, unless `legend: true` moves it to a legend row. |
| `overlays[].legend` | boolean | Key this line in the legend instead of labelling it in-frame — see [Keying annotations in the legend](#keying-annotations-in-the-legend-legend-true). Needs a `label`. A **per-series** fit gets ONE row for the concept, not one per series. Its swatch is the colour its lines actually resolve to — an explicit `color` whatever the series count, else the series' own colour on a single-series chart — and the dim annotation neutral only when they resolve to **several** colours, which one line swatch cannot carry (those colours are already keyed by the series legend). On a chart with `legend: false` there is nowhere to move the label to, so it stays in-frame. **The entry must hold enough values to resolve a line:** a `method` fit whose column holds fewer numeric cells than `degree + 1`, or a `column` holding fewer than two, is dropped by the renderer, and a legend row for a line that is not on the chart is a validation error. A **per-series** entry needs only ONE drawable series — the row keys the concept, so a series that cannot be fitted does not forfeit it. This counts cells, and does not ask how they sit: a `column` sparse enough that blanks isolate every value (`5`, blank, `7`) clears it and keeps its row, painting those values as dots with no segment between them, since a blank is a break. |
| `overlays[].color` | color | Named token or `"#hex"`. Omitted ⇒ the series' colour for a per-series `method`/`column`, else the dim annotation neutral. |
| `overlays[].style` | enum | `dashed` \| `solid`. **The default depends on the kind:** `method` and `column` draw **solid**, `fun` and `slope`+`intercept` draw **dashed**. A line computed *from* these data and one asserted *over* them are different claims, and the dash is what says which. |
| `overlays[].strokeWidth` | number | Default 1.5. |
| `overlays[].labelSide` | enum | Which side of the line the label sits: `top` (default) \| `middle` \| `bottom`. On a line **steeper than 45° on screen** the clearing direction flips to horizontal — a few px of vertical nudge cannot clear a line that climbs further than that across the width of the text, so the label moves beside the line instead, on whichever side of the frame has more room, with its text running away from the line. Above/below has no meaning against a near-vertical line, so `labelSide` becomes a side TOGGLE there: `bottom` puts the label on the opposite side from that default, `top` and `middle` take the roomier side. Steepness is a SCREEN property, so it depends on the frame's aspect and the axis ranges, not on the data slope alone — the same fit can be shallow on a wide frame and steep on a narrow one. It is measured against the plot's NOMINAL inner size, so a pane whose margins are adjusted (a shared small-multiples column, say) can classify a line sitting right at the boundary differently from how it looks. |
| `overlays[].labelPosition` | enum | Where along the line it anchors: `left` (first point) \| `middle` \| `right` (last point, default). An overlay is sloped, so this picks a point **on** the line rather than a frame edge — and specifically on the part of the line **inside the frame**. A line is drawn across its `domain`, which routinely leaves the view (a steep `domain: axis` fit exceeds the value axis; an explicit `domain` can run past the x axis), and since labels are never clipped, anchoring at the true endpoint put the label off-canvas where nobody could see it. The line is clipped to the frame first, so `right` means the last point you can SEE. A line with no visible portion at all draws no label. |
| `overlays[].labelDx` / `.labelDy` | number | px nudges — **`+labelDx` = right, `+labelDy` = up**, as everywhere in `annotations`. |
| `overlays[].tooltip` | boolean | Add a row to the **hover tooltip** giving this line's value at the hovered x. Default **off**: an overlay is usually chrome — a reference slope, a target — whose value at an arbitrary x says nothing, and three lines all reporting into one card is noise; a fitted trend is the case where it says a lot. Needs a `label`, which is the row's text. **Honoured on the chart types whose hover resolves a single x, wherever the hover draws a card at all:** `line` and `area` (the continuous crosshair) standalone; in small-multiples panes **only with `small_multiples.coordinated_cursor: false`**, or on a figure that resolves to a single pane (which has nothing to coordinate) — the coordinated cursor, on by default for a multi-pane figure, replaces a line/area pane's floating card with an in-place guide, per-series dot and value pill, and with no card there is no row and the overlay's value is not reported; and `scatter` (per-point hover — the row is the line's value at that point's x, and a per-series fit for a *different* series is omitted). **Silently ignored on `chartType: histogram`**, whose hover resolves a bin *range* rather than an x, so there is no one value to report. The number shown is read off the drawn polyline, so it is the height the line has at that position: outside the `domain` the line is drawn over, in a pane `facet` excludes, or across a break from a blank `column` cell, there is no row rather than an extrapolated one. `chrome.tooltip: false` suppresses the whole card, this row included. A per-series fit gets one row per series, the series named in the row only when two rows would otherwise share one label. |
| `overlays[].facet` | string | Small multiples: scope this overlay to the pane whose facet value matches. The scoping covers the **value axis** as well as the drawing — a `column` overlay folds into the extent only in the pane that draws it, since in `mode: shared` a widened pane would otherwise drag every other pane's axis with it. The pane must be one the figure actually renders — a value `pane_order` excludes is a validation error, since the line would be drawn nowhere while still keying its legend row. |

**The value axis, and why `column` is different.** A `column` overlay's values **are** folded into the
value-axis extent, the same way `confidence_bands`' `lower`/`upper` columns and `annotations.yAxis`
values are: it is real per-row data the author supplied, and silently dropping it off-frame would be a
worse failure than a slightly taller axis. Only the part of the column the line actually **draws**
folds in — `domain` and `facet` crop the extent exactly as they crop the geometry, and a group left
with fewer than two values in range draws no line and widens nothing. The other three kinds are **constructed** lines whose extent
is unbounded by design — `domain: axis` extrapolates as far as the frame goes — so they never widen the
axis and are clipped at the frame instead. If you want a fit's full range visible, set
`yAxisPolicy.min`/`.max`.

**The `fun` grammar.** Arithmetic — `+ - * / ^`, parentheses, unary minus — over `x`, the constants
`pi` and `e`, and any `params` key. **Precedence follows R:** `^` is right-associative and binds tighter
than unary minus, so `-2^2` is `-4` and `2^3^2` is `512`.

Functions, R spelling canonical with the Stata spelling accepted where the two differ: `log` (natural;
`log(x, base)` for another base), `ln`, `log10`, `log2`, `exp`, `sqrt`, `abs`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`,
`floor`, `ceiling`, `ceil`, `round`, `min`, `max`, `dnorm`, `normalden`. Anything else is a validation
error, as is a variable that is neither `x`, a constant, nor a declared `params` key — so a typo fails
the build rather than drawing nothing in the browser.

A sample point that evaluates to `NaN` or `±Inf` **breaks** the line there instead of erroring, so
`fun: "log(x)"` over a domain crossing zero draws only the half that exists.

An argument outside a function's mathematical domain breaks the line the same way, rather than
returning a number: `dnorm`/`normalden` with a standard deviation of zero or less, and `log(x, base)`
with a base of zero, one or negative. Those two are guarded explicitly because plain floating-point
arithmetic hands back a *finite* value for them — a negative `sd` yields the density with its sign
flipped, drawing a smooth inverted curve below the axis, and `log(x, 0)` yields `-0`, drawing a flat
line along zero. Every other domain edge (`sqrt` of a negative, `log`/`ln` of a non-positive, a
division by zero) is already non-finite and breaks without a guard.

`dnorm` is there so a density curve can go over a histogram — the one overlay kind histograms support,
along with `slope`+`intercept`. It only reads correctly with `histogram.normalize: density`; against raw
counts the curve's y-scale is meaningless.

```yaml
# A normal density over a histogram. `fun` is the only fitting-shaped kind available here.
chartType: histogram
xAxisType: numeric
histogram: { normalize: density }
overlays:
  - fun: "dnorm(x, 4.2, 1.6)"
    label: Normal density
    legend: true
```

```yaml
# A scatter with a fit across the whole frame, plus a line whose coefficients came from a multivariate
# regression run upstream (the engine fits bivariate only).
chartType: scatter
xAxisType: numeric
overlays:
  - method: lm
    by: none
    domain: axis                    # span the frame, not just the data
  - fun: "b0 + b1*x"
    params: { b0: 673.4, b1: -0.0451 }
    domain: axis
    label: Fitted line (prelim slope)
    legend: true                    # the fit above stays unkeyed
```

```yaml
# A quadratic with a 95% band, per series.
overlays:
  - method: poly
    degree: 2
    ci: 0.95
    label: Quadratic fit
    legend: true
```

```yaml
# A 45-degree reference line, and a fit computed elsewhere brought in as a column.
overlays:
  - slope: 1
    intercept: 0
    label: "45°"
  - column: yhat
```

### Line & area options

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `points` | boolean | Line charts: draw a marker dot at each data point. Default false. |
| `projected_field` | string | Data column whose truthy value (`1`/`true`/`yes`, case-insensitive, trimmed) flags a row as projected (forecast/estimated) rather than actual. **Line:** the flagged run(s) of a series draw dashed, connecting continuously to adjacent actual points — a series may have multiple disjoint projected runs. **Area (stacked):** the fill fades over x-ranges where *every* in-scope series is flagged projected (conservative — a stack can't express partial-series fading). Absent ⇒ no projected styling (byte-identical output). A series also listed in `series_styles[..].dashed` (whole-series dashed) is not split by this field — the whole-series override wins. |
| `projected_style.dashed` | boolean | Line charts, only consulted when `projected_field` is set. Default true; `false` renders the projected run solid (opts out of the visual distinction while keeping the field wired). |
| `projected_style.fillOpacity` | number | Area charts, only consulted when `projected_field` is set. Effective fill opacity of the projected x-range's white veil overlay. Default 0.2. |

Area charts (`chartType: area`) stack their series (a single series fills to the zero baseline);
stack order follows `series_order`. The hover tooltip adds a cumulative **Total** row wherever the
card shows more than one series row — the sum of one row is that row, so a single-series area chart
gets no Total row, and neither does a hovered x where only one series has a value. Selecting series
in the legend animates them to the bottom of the stack so they can be read against
zero. The Total row is **standalone only**: a multi-pane area figure's coordinated cursor replaces
each pane's card with value pills that report each series' own value, so the cumulative stack height
is not reported anywhere. Plan for that if the total is the number your reader needs — a single-pane
area chart, or `small_multiples.coordinated_cursor: false`, keeps the card and its Total.

### Point charts (scatter / dot plot)

The shape **column** is set via `columns.shape`; these mirror the `series_*` fields for the
shape-encoding legend. When color and shape encode different fields, each legend is titled.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `shape_order` | array | Shape render order; also an inclusion filter. |
| `shape_labels` | object | `{ <shapeKey>: "Display label" }` for the shape legend. |
| `color_legend_title` | string | Heading above the color (series) legend group. |
| `shape_legend_title` | string | Heading above the shape legend group. |

### Bar / stacked-bar options

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `orientation` | enum | `vertical` (default; value axis is Y) \| `horizontal`. |
| `x_axis_ticks` | enum | **Horizontal bars only** (standalone and faceted). Where the value-axis tick row(s) render: `bottom` (default) \| `top` \| `both`. Requires `orientation: horizontal` — validation rejects it on a vertical chart (there is no top value axis there). |
| `valueLabels.show` | boolean | Show the always-on value labels the chart type has: per-segment labels on **stacked bars** (in-bar labels for plain/grouped bars were removed), and the running-total level after each step on a **waterfall**. Default off. Two refusals on stacked bars — a diverging (net-dot) stack draws none, and neither does a small-multiples pane — plus a per-**segment** one: a segment too thin to hold its number cleanly (under 25px along the value axis, at the rendered frame size) is skipped. **Where these labels are painted for EVERY segment, the hover value pills default to off** (`chrome.valuePills`): the numbers are already in the bars, and the pills would repeat them a few pixels away. If any segment's label was skipped, the pills stay on for the whole chart — a chart whose labels do not cover every segment must keep the hover number, because the hover treatment behind painted labels is the pills rather than the tooltip card, so a skipped segment would otherwise show no number anywhere. It moves the DEFAULT only — `chrome.valuePills: true` still wins and shows both. A **waterfall** keeps its pills regardless: its label is the running *level* while its hover pill is the signed *delta* on a delta step (a `total` or `skip` step has no pill to duplicate anything with), so there is nothing duplicated there. |
| `valueLabels.decimals` | integer | Fixed decimal places for the labels that remain (stacked segment + net callouts); else the minimum the data needs, capped at 2. |
| `barStack.netDisplay` | enum | The net (sum) **callout** on stacked bars: `auto` (default — dot if any value is negative, else text) \| `text` \| `dot` \| `none`. This chooses the marker and nothing else; it no longer decides the hover treatment — see `barStack.hover`. `none` also suppresses the "Total" legend entry. |
| `barStack.hover` | enum | Which hover treatment the chart gets, independent of the callout: `tooltip` (the floating card, with a Total row) \| `pills` (per-segment value pills on the hovered band). Omitted ⇒ the historical coupling — `tooltip` when `netDisplay` resolves to a dot, else `pills`. Two reasons to set it explicitly. **A tooltip with no dot:** `netDisplay: none` + `hover: tooltip` gives the card its Total row as plain text (there is no dot to key), draws no marker and no "Total" legend row, and — because both come from the spec rather than a stylesheet — the PNG export agrees. **Determinism:** `netDisplay: auto` resolves to a dot only when some value is negative, so a series that dips below zero at some dial settings silently flipped the reader between a tooltip and value pills; naming `hover` pins it. A 100 %-normalized stack never gets a Total row either way — its total is always 100 — and neither does a card showing a single series row, since the sum of one row is that row. |
| `barStack.total.position` | enum | Where the tooltip's Total row sits: `last` (default) \| `first`. |
| `barStack.total.bold` | boolean | Bold the Total row's label (the value is already bold). Default **on** — every stacked chart with a Total row gets a bold label unless this is set to `false`. |
| `barStack.total.divider` | boolean | Rule separating the Total row from the series rows. **The side flips with `barStack.total.position`**: `last` (default) draws the rule ABOVE the Total row, since it sits below the series rows; `first` draws it BELOW, since it sits above them — either way the rule separates the Total row from the series rows, never from the category header. Default **on** — set `false` to opt out. |
| `barStack.mono.base` | color | Monochrome stack: render all segments as shades of one base hue (a categorical hue key or alias; see [Colors](#colors)). |
| `barStack.netLabelColor` | enum | `white` \| `black`. |
| `barStack.normalize` | boolean | Normalize each bar to 100%. |
| `barStack.stackOrder` | array | Visual bottom→top stack order, independent of `series_order` (which still drives legend + colors). |
| `barStack.segmentGap` | number | px of whitespace **between** adjacent stacked segments. Default `0` (segments abut). Separates two slices from the same hue family without spending another color. Applied as subtractive geometry, not a stroke: each segment's trailing edge is pulled in, floored at 0.5px so a slice thinner than the gap survives as a hairline rather than being painted over. **No gap is added at the bar's outer ends** — the baseline and the total do not move, and the net marker stays at the true net. A genuine `0` value stays zero-height. With `valueLabels.show`, each label re-centres on its segment as gapped, but the gap never changes **whether** a label is drawn: the ~25px fit threshold is a judgement about a segment's share of the data, applied once to the un-gapped extent, and a rect that cleared it is at worst 13px after the maximum gap — still room for a 10px glyph. Honored in both orientations, on 100%-normalized stacks, in small-multiples panes, and in the PNG export. Max 12. |
| `highlightSeries` | array | Series keys to emphasize (dims all others). |
| `legendPosition` | enum | `top` \| `right`, **on a standalone live chart wide enough to hold a right column**. Default `top`, except a diverging stacked chart or one with ≥5 series defaults to `right`. **The count is of the SERIES rows the legend actually shows**, so `series_legend: false` removes them and a chart that qualified only on count falls back to `top` — a right-hand column holding just overlay rows would be a tall gutter for two lines of text. **A DIVERGING stacked chart still resolves `right`**: that test is on the data (any negative value), not on the legend, so suppressing the series rows does not reach it. **Four routes ignore this field entirely, an explicit value included** — `legend: false` resolves `top` before the field is read (unobservable, since no legend is drawn); a card narrower than the right-column minimum falls back to `top` at mount (and a card that STARTS wide and is later narrowed keeps its right column — the resize path re-resolves the position but does not dismantle a right legend already built, a long-standing limitation); a `small_multiples` figure has only a top legend slot; and the **PNG export always draws the legend above the chart**, so a standalone chart with a right legend on screen exports with it on top. Where a right legend is possible, an explicit value wins over the defaults above. |
| `series_legend` | boolean | Set `false` to drop the **series rows** from the legend while keeping the rows overlays and annotations opted into with `legend: true`. For a chart whose colour channel does not need naming because the points are identified some other way — a `columns.point_label`, or a single highlighted observation the note explains. Distinct from `legend: false` directly below, which removes the whole box (and, having nowhere to put them, pushes overlay labels back in-frame). Because the box survives, click-to-pin/dim still works for the rows that remain. One caveat, and it is per DIMENSION rather than per legend: colour/annotation rows and shape rows are selected independently, and each dims only on a strict subset of its own dimension. So selecting a row that is the only one left in **its** dimension dims nothing — which `series_legend: false` makes reachable on a dual-encoding point chart, where it strips the colour rows but **not** the shape rows (those follow the top-level `legend` only), leaving a lone overlay row in the colour/annotation dimension beside two live shape rows. The same is already true of a single-series scatter with one keyed overlay. Not chart-type specific. Default true. |
| `legend` | boolean | Set `false` to hide the legend entirely (top/right/figure/PNG export alike) while keeping multi-series coloring, tooltips, and crosshair. Click-to-pin/dim is consequently unavailable, since it's driven through the legend. Default true. Not bar-specific — applies to any chart type with a legend. |
| `chrome.tooltip` | boolean | Turn the floating hover-tooltip card off, from the spec itself rather than a stylesheet — so the PNG export (which re-renders from the spec, never sees CSS) agrees. Hit-testing and the band/point highlight are untouched; only the card is suppressed. Applies to any chart type that has a tooltip — which is a real restriction, not a formality: on a chart whose hover is the coordinated cursor or the value pills rather than a card (see `small_multiples.coordinated_cursor` and `barStack.hover`) there is no card to suppress and this switch is a no-op, pills included. Use `chrome.valuePills` for those. Default true. Not bar-specific. |
| `chrome.valuePills` | boolean | Turn off the per-segment value pills a reader sees hovering a band (bar, stacked-bar), and the legend-gesture value pills (bar, stacked-bar, dot-plot). On a **faceted** figure it also covers the coordinated cursor's per-series pills, on the hovered pane as well as on the echoed panes. Only the pills go: the guide line, the band/bin highlight, the per-series hover dots, the hovered pane's category echo, and hit-testing are untouched. Default true — **except where `valueLabels.show` has painted the numbers into EVERY segment** (a stacked chart that is not diverging, not a small-multiples pane, and with no segment too thin for its label), where the default flips to **off** so the hover does not repeat them. One skipped segment label keeps the default at true for the whole chart, so that segment still gets a number. That is a change of default, not an override: `true` here still wins and shows both, and `false` still suppresses them anywhere. |

`chrome` is deliberately just these two switches. There is no `chrome.netMarker` or `chrome.legend`: each already has an owning field, and adding a second one here would just be a second formula for the same decision — use `barStack.netDisplay: none` for the net marker (see above) and the top-level `legend: false` (directly above) for the legend.

#### Why `bar` and `stacked` refuse a continuous axis

Both require `xAxisType: categorical`. The rule is stricter than the defect it prevents — one shape
on a numeric axis renders correctly and is refused anyway — so here is what the axis actually does,
and why the exception is not carved out.

Bars are positioned on a **band** scale, which needs a domain of discrete keys. Only the categorical
x-axis builds that domain from the data's x values. On a numeric axis, the domain handed to the band
scale is the numeric domain, `[min, max]` — a two-element array, which the band scale reads as
**exactly two categories: the endpoints**. A row is drawn only if its x *is* one of those two
endpoints. So, measured through the renderer on a vertical single-series `bar`:

| rows | bars drawn | x tick labels |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | 2 of 2 — every row, correctly | `1`, `2` |
| 3 | 2 of 3 | `1`, `3` |
| 5 | 2 of 5 | `1`, `5` |

A two-row chart is complete because its x set *is* its own endpoints. That is a coincidence of how
the domain is derived, not a supported case, and it is refused for three reasons: the exception is
really "numeric **and** vertical **and** exactly two distinct x values" — a rule no author should
have to carry; validation reads the spec, not the data, so narrowing it would make a figure's
validity depend on today's row count, and a working two-row chart would start failing the day its
data grew a third row; and the failure profile of allowing it is the worst available — right at two
rows, quietly short at three, with no warning at any count.

The other combinations fail differently, and none of them silently drop *only* interior rows:
`orientation: horizontal` draws **no bars at all** on any continuous axis and at any row count (its
band domain is built from string categories, which a continuous adapter never produces, so the mark
is dropped whole). `temporal` and `quarterly` draw **every** bar, but stack a second x-axis over the
engine's, leak an internal field name as the axis label, and paint the renderer's warning glyph into
the SVG — which the PNG export re-renders into the published image.

For values over years, ages or percentiles, declare the x values as categories and use `x_order` to
fix their order, or use `chartType: line`. Making a genuine continuous-x bar chart work is a feature
with axis-ordering, hover and export surface; refusing it now is what keeps that an additive change
later.

### Histogram options

`chartType: histogram` bins a continuous x column into edge-to-edge bars. `xAxisType` must be
`numeric` or `temporal`. By default the engine bins **raw** rows (one row per observation); mapping
`columns.x0` + `columns.x1` switches to **pre-binned** input instead (see below).

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `histogram.bins` | integer | Target bin **count**. Ignored when `binWidth` is set. |
| `histogram.binWidth` | number \| string | Bin **width**. Numeric x: a number in x-units. Temporal x: a calendar interval name — `day` \| `week` \| `month` \| `quarter` \| `year` — **or** a plain number, interpreted as a day count. |
| `histogram.domain` | `[number, number]` | Explicit binning range `[min, max]`. Default: the data extent. |
| `histogram.normalize` | enum | Bar-height normalization: `none` (default, raw counts/weights) \| `proportion` (each series' bins sum to 1) \| `density` (each series' area — Σ height × bin width — sums to 1). |
| `histogram.weight` | string | Column **summed** per bin (a weighted histogram) instead of counting rows. Default: row count. Ignored (and rejected — see below) for pre-binned data. |
| `histogram.bin_label` | object | Friendly formatting of the hovered bin's range label. See below. |

**Bin-range hover labels (`histogram.bin_label`).** The hovered bin is named by a friendly label
rather than a mathematical interval. It reaches whichever surface the chart hovers with: the
tooltip card's header on a standalone histogram, and the coordinated cursor's echoed bin label in a
small-multiples pane, which is built from the same formatter with the same options so the two agree. Numeric x renders an en-dash range (`47.9 – 50.7`).
Temporal x whose `binWidth` is a calendar interval name collapses each bin to its period name
(`month` → `July 2023`, `quarter` → `Q3 2023`, `year` → `2023`, `week` → `Week of July 2, 2023`,
`day` → `July 5, 2023`); any other temporal binning (a bin count, or a day-count `binWidth`) renders
a month range (`July – September 2023`, or `July 2023 – March 2024` across years).

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `histogram.bin_label.unit` | string | Applied to each **numeric** edge, e.g. `"$"`, `"%"`, `" yrs"`. Ignored for temporal labels. A suffix unit that begins with a space (`" yrs"`) is appended once to the range; a tight suffix (`"%"`) attaches to each edge. |
| `histogram.bin_label.unit_position` | enum | `prefix` \| `suffix`. Default `suffix`. |
| `histogram.bin_label.decimals` | integer | Numeric edge rounding. Default: smart trim to ≤2 fraction digits (drops float-accumulation noise). |

**Bin-width precedence:** `binWidth` > `bins` > **auto**. With neither set, the engine picks a bin
count itself via the Freedman–Diaconis rule, falling back to Sturges' rule when the data's IQR is
zero (e.g. a near-constant column).

**Pre-binned input.** Map `columns.x0` + `columns.x1` to the columns holding each row's bin lower/
upper edge; `columns.value` (default `"value"`) supplies the bar height directly, and the engine
draws the given edges as-is rather than computing its own — edges may be uneven. Because there is
no data left to bin, the `histogram` block's binning fields (`bins`, `binWidth`, `domain`,
`weight`) are meaningless in this mode and **validation rejects the spec** if any are set alongside
`columns.x0`/`x1`. (`histogram.normalize` still applies, reusing the same
proportion/density logic over the given bin heights.)

**Overlapping multi-series.** With `columns.series` set, each series draws its own translucent bar
layer over a **shared** set of bins — series don't stack or dodge, they overlay, so the visual
answers "how do these distributions compare" rather than "what's the combined total." `series_order`
still controls z-order and legend/color assignment; a series with no observations in a bin renders
a zero-height bar there (not a gap) so all series share the same bin count.

**Faceting.** Combine `columns.facet` with `small_multiples` as usual. `small_multiples.mode`
governs how bins are computed per pane:

- `shared` (default) — one set of bin thresholds is computed across **all** in-scope rows and
  reused by every pane, so panes share a common x-domain and their bars line up for cross-pane
  comparison.
- `per-pane` — each pane bins only its own rows, independently (its own thresholds, possibly a
  different bin count/domain than its neighbors).

> **Pre-binned + faceting caveat.** The `shared` mode's cross-pane threshold computation only
> applies to **raw** data that the engine bins itself. Pre-binned panes (`columns.x0`/`x1`) already
> carry their own edges per row, and those edges are **not** coordinated across panes in `shared`
> mode — each pane simply renders the edges its own rows supply. If you need pre-binned facets to
> line up on a common x-axis, give every facet the same bin edges yourself in the source data.

### Dumbbell options

`chartType: dumbbell` draws a **connected dot plot**: one dot per series in each category, joined
by a connector "stem", so the **gap** between series is the visual subject — for two or three
values that compare but don't sum (e.g. current-law vs. static vs. collected effective rates).
`xAxisType` must be `categorical`; `orientation` decides the rendering (`horizontal`, default —
categories down the left, values along x — or `vertical`). Map the categorical column via
`columns.category` (or `columns.x`), the value via `columns.value`, and the dot identity via
`columns.series`. Series color/order/labels reuse the shared `series_*` fields; category order
reuses `category_order` (or `x_order`); faceting reuses `columns.facet` + `small_multiples`.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `orientation` | enum | `horizontal` (default; categories on the y band, values on x) \| `vertical`. |
| `series_marker` | object | Per-series dot style: `filled` (solid series color) \| `hollow` (ring — series-color outline, and the center is a HOLE, so the connector stem and whatever the figure sits on show through it) \| `ink` (filled neutral ink). Unlisted series default to `filled`. Lets "static/ask" read hollow and "collected" filled. The legend swatch matches (a hollow series shows a ring). |
| `connector` | object | Stem styling: `connector.color` (a color token/hex), `connector.width` (px, default 1.5), `connector.style` (`solid` default \| `dashed` \| `dotted`). Default a subtle neutral line drawn behind the dots. A single-dot (or exactly-coincident) category draws no stem. |
| `dot_radius` | number | Dot radius in px. Default 5. |
| `gap_annotation` | boolean \| object | Label the numeric gap between two series on each stem. `true` uses the first two series in order; an object names them: `{ series_a, series_b, format? }`. `format` (else `value_format`) formats the number. Default off. |
| `value_axis_title` | string | Short caption on the value axis. |
| `value_format` | object | Number format for values in labels: `{ decimals, prefix, suffix }` (e.g. `{ decimals: 1, suffix: "%" }`). |

The value axis **fits the data** and does **not** force a zero baseline (a 2%–35% rate view keeps
its useful range); zero is included only when the dots cross it, and a zero rule is drawn there.
Faceted dumbbells share a common value scale by default (`small_multiples.mode: per-pane` gives
each pane its own).

**Hover & coordinated cursor.** Hovering anywhere in a category's band (a row for horizontal, a
column for vertical) highlights that band and shows a tooltip listing each series' value. In a
faceted dumbbell the cursor is coordinated — hovering a category echoes the band highlight on every
pane (unless `coordinated_cursor: false`).

**Sections (horizontal).** `columns.section` groups the categories into labeled blocks with bold
headers in the left gutter, exactly like horizontal bars (`section_order` / `section_labels`
control order and header text). Horizontal orientation only.

```yaml
chartType: dumbbell
orientation: horizontal
xAxisType: categorical
columns: { category: group, series: measure, value: rate }
category_order: [Quintile 1, Quintile 2, Quintile 3, Quintile 4, Quintile 5]
series_order: [current_law, static, collected]
series_labels: { current_law: Current law, static: Static rate, collected: Collected after behavior }
series_marker: { current_law: ink, static: hollow, collected: filled }
value_axis_title: Effective tax rate
value_format: { decimals: 1, suffix: "%" }
gap_annotation: { series_a: static, series_b: collected }
```

### Small multiples

Set `columns.facet` to the pane-splitting column, then tune the grid here.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `small_multiples.columns` | integer | Grid column **count** (distinct from the `columns` role map). Default derived (≈ ceil(√n), capped). |
| `small_multiples.mode` | enum | `shared` (one y-scale, y-labels in the left column only — default) \| `per-pane` (each pane its own y-scale/units). |
| `small_multiples.pane_order` | array | Pane render order + inclusion filter. |
| `small_multiples.pane_titles` | object | `{ <facetValue>: "Display title" }`. Falls back to the raw facet value. |
| `small_multiples.coordinated_cursor` | boolean | Hovering one pane echoes a secondary cursor on every pane at the same x. Default true. A figure that resolves to a single **line/area/point** pane has nothing to coordinate and behaves as if this were `false` — but a single **bar or stacked** pane stays coordinated on purpose (the bar-end value pill is that chart type's hover treatment whether or not there are sibling panes), so there `false` is *not* equivalent to the default: it brings back the floating card. On a **line/area** pane the coordinated cursor *replaces* that pane's floating tooltip card with the in-place cursor — guide, per-series dot, value pill — so a reader gets the values from the pills rather than a card, and `overlays[].tooltip` has no card to report into. |
| `small_multiples.pane_widths` | enum \| array | How a row's width splits among its columns (vertical bar facets; applied to every row). `equal` (default) — same data width per column. `equal-bar` — each column sized to its bar count so bars render at the same width (exact for a single row; multi-row uses the max bar count per column). An array like `[2, 1]` sets explicit per-column proportions (length must equal the column count). When set and `columns` is unset, the panes lay out in a single row. |

**Faceted horizontal bars/stacks.** `orientation: horizontal` combines with `small_multiples` to
produce a faceted horizontal chart: each pane is one facet value, the panes share a single value (x)
axis, and the category labels form a shared left gutter sized to the longest label — shown on the
leftmost pane only, so the rows line up across panes. Works with single-series, grouped (multi-series),
and **stacked** bars. Use `shared` mode (the default) so the value axis is comparable across panes.
On a diverging stack, `barStack.netDisplay: dot` keeps the net dot in each pane (at a reduced radius);
the net text callout and per-segment value labels are suppressed in panes.
`barStack.hover` applies per pane exactly as it does to a standalone chart, so a faceted stack can
take the tooltip without the dot. With `columns: 1` each facet occupies its own row with its own
full-width category axis, so facets may carry **different** categories (the shared-category
requirement — see below — applies only when panes share a row).

### Section axis (horizontal bars)

Set `columns.section` to group the category axis into labeled sections (horizontal bar charts only).
Categories are ordered so each section is contiguous, with a bold section header in the left gutter
and a gap between sections. Combines with `small_multiples` (the headers show on the leftmost pane).

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `columns.section` | string | Column whose distinct values define the sections. |
| `section_order` | array | Section render order along the category axis; also an inclusion filter (like `series_order`). |
| `section_labels` | object | `{ <sectionValue>: "Display label" }` for the section headers. |

`columns.section` and `columns.facet` are supported together on faceted horizontal bars (both
`shared` and `per-pane` `small_multiples.mode`). When panes share a row (`columns > 1`), faceted
horizontal bars/stacks share one category axis across those panes, so every facet must carry the
same categories (and sections) — a facet missing a category or a whole section (a **ragged facet**)
fails validation with an error naming the facet and the missing categories/sections, rather than
silently misaligning rows across panes. This does not apply with `columns: 1` (each facet is on its
own row with its own category axis, so different categories per facet are allowed).

### Data

`data` is usually the bare filename. The object forms support a local file or a remote source.

| form | notes |
|---|---|
| `data: data.csv` | String — sugar for `{ file: "data.csv" }`. The common case. |
| `data: { file: "..." }` | Explicit local file, relative to the chart folder. |
| `data: { url: "...", format: "csv"\|"json", map?: {...} }` | Remote source. For JSON, `map` renames source fields onto the tidy shape: `{ timeField, seriesField, valueField }`. |

### Catalog

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tags` | array | Free-form facet tags (recorded by consuming repos' catalogs; ignored by the renderer). |

### Customisation

Everything above this point is `chart.yaml` — data the CLI publishing pipeline JSON-serialises,
together with the data rows, into a standalone HTML bundle it then screenshots with headless
Chromium (`src/cli/index.ts` → `buildStandaloneHtml`). A function cannot survive that
serialisation, so the surface below is **not** part of `chart.yaml` and has no YAML keys — it is
JavaScript, passed directly to `mountChart`/`renderChart`/`renderFigure` by a consumer embedding
the engine itself (not by a published figure). If you are only authoring `chart.yaml`/`data.csv`
for a catalog figure, none of this applies to you.

#### Hooks

`hooks` (a `RenderHooks` object; see `src/spec/hooks.ts`) lets a consumer intercept specific,
narrow pieces of what the engine draws, without forking the renderer. Every hook returns `null` to
mean "engine default" — a hook can handle one case and defer the rest, and passing `hooks: {}` is
byte-identical to passing no `hooks` at all.

| hook | fires for | identical in the PNG export? |
|---|---|---|
| `tickLabel` | one value-axis tick's text | Yes |
| `valueLabel` | one in-mark value label (stacked segment / net callout, waterfall running total) | Yes |
| `legendKey` | one legend row's key markup | Yes — **but see `ctx.medium` below** |
| `afterRender` | the assembled SVG itself, live and export alike (`ctx.phase` says which) | It runs on both, by construction — but see the note below: the two SVGs are not the same size |
| `tooltip` | a band tooltip's content — on the few chart types that draw one at default settings; **see the reach table below before relying on it** | **No — screen-only, see below** |

**`tickLabel`, `valueLabel` and `legendKey` are guaranteed identical between the screen and the
downloaded PNG**, because the export re-renders through the very same builders with the very same
`hooks` object — it does not serialise the live DOM. This is the guarantee
`test/hooks-export-parity.test.ts` gates: it renders all four hooks together and asserts the export's
marks and text match the live render's.

**`afterRender` is guaranteed to RUN on both paths, with `ctx.phase` naming which — not to produce
identical output.** The export re-renders into its own frame: a fixed 920px-wide content column by a
height computed from the chart's chrome, against the live card's own width by its own height. A hook
that positions or sizes anything off the SVG it is handed therefore lands at different coordinates in
the PNG than on screen, and no way of writing the hook changes that. (A consumer can also branch on
`ctx.phase` and differ on purpose — but the frame-size difference applies even to a hook that does
not.) Keep an `afterRender` mutation relative to the SVG's own dimensions if it must survive the trip,
and check the download rather than assuming it matches. `test/hooks-export-parity.test.ts` gates both
halves: that the hook fires once per path and both SVGs carry its mutation, and that the two frames
really are different sizes.

**`hooks.tooltip` is screen-only.** A static PNG export has no hover state, so there is nothing for
a tooltip's content to be identical *to* — the hook is simply never invoked while building an
export. It also has a **much** narrower reach than the other four, and the reach is not a list of
chart types: it is wired at the two `buildBandTooltipHtml` call sites only —
`attachBandCrosshair` (bar/stacked-bar/waterfall) and `attachCategoricalLineCrosshair` (dot-plot,
dumbbell, categorical-x line) — and it fires **only where one of those actually draws a floating
card**. Most of those chart types do not, at default settings: their hover is the in-place
coordinated cursor (guide, per-series dot, value pill) instead, and a hook that replaces card
content has no card to replace. Where the hook fires, at defaults:

| chart type | hook fires? | why not |
|---|---|---|
| `dumbbell` | **yes**, standalone and faceted | — |
| `dotplot`, categorical-x `line` | **standalone only** | a multi-pane figure's coordinated cursor replaces each pane's card |
| `stacked` | **only where the net dot is drawn** — i.e. a stack with a negative value, or an explicit `barStack.hover: "tooltip"`; standalone and faceted alike | an all-positive stack hovers with per-segment value pills, not a card |
| `bar` (plain or grouped), `waterfall` | **never, in any configuration** | `resolveHoverMode` returns `"pills"` whenever the chart is not a stack, ahead of reading `barStack.hover` at all — these two have no card to hook |
| temporal/numeric-x `line`, `area`, `histogram`, `scatter` | **never** | their cards are built by `attachCrosshair` / `attachHistogramHover` / `attachPointHover`, which do not call this hook |

`test/hover-card-reach.test.ts` gates every row of that table by mounting each chart type at
default settings, standalone and two-pane, and asserting both whether a card appears and whether
the hook fires. If you need to intercept hover content on a chart type marked "never", the hook is
the wrong tool — there is no card there to intercept, and `hooks.tooltip` will not create one. On
the categorical bar/stacked types, the `onHover` **event** does report the resolved category and
values whether or not a card is drawn (it fires ahead of the same gate that suppresses the card);
see the events table below for the chart types it covers.

**`legendKey`'s `ctx.medium` is `"html"` on the live legend and `"svg"` in the export — a returned
string must be written in THAT vocabulary, not just `ctx.rendered` echoed back unconditionally.**
This is the single easiest thing to get wrong here: the live legend is an HTML button, so
`<span>`/`<b>` markup renders there; the export's legend is flat SVG rasterised via
`XMLSerializer → Image → canvas`, and an HTML node placed into that tree lands in the XHTML
namespace and **silently does not paint** — no error, no warning, just a legend key that is
correct on screen and missing from the download. Switch on `ctx.medium` (or simply return
`ctx.rendered` unchanged, which is already written in the right vocabulary for the call you're in).

**A throwing hook is handled inconsistently, not uniformly forbidden.** `tickLabel`, `valueLabel`,
and `afterRender` run inside `mountChart`'s own try/catch, so a throw there is caught and rendered
as an in-card `.figure-error`. `legendKey` (called from `renderLegend`) and `tooltip` (called from
the crosshair/tooltip attach) run **after** that try/catch, so a throw there propagates uncaught out
of `mountChart` and leaves the mount without a legend or hover wiring until the next resize
re-attempts it.

`onHover`/`onRender`/`onLegendSelect` are not hooks — they're described under Events below.

#### Events

Three callbacks, each passed alongside `hooks` to `mountChart`, and each **also** dispatched as a
bubbling `CustomEvent` of the same name (`detail` = the same object) from the chart's card root —
so a published standalone figure's host page can observe it with a plain `addEventListener`, with
no callback wired through JavaScript at mount time.

| event | callback | fires | frequency note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hover | `onHover` | `attachBandCrosshair` only — categorical bar/stacked band crosshairs, standalone and faceted. **Not** wired for line, scatter, histogram, dot-plot, dumbbell, or categorical-line charts; those report nothing, which is not the same as "no hover occurred." | Fires on every `pointermove`, and once more with `null` on pointer-leave. Consumers wanting less than that should debounce/throttle themselves. |
| Render | `onRender` | Once per mount, once per width-driven resize, once per title-selector reselect, and once per area-chart click-to-restack. `ctx.phase` is `"mount" \| "resize" \| "reselect" \| "restack"`. A small-multiples figure fires once **per pane**. | **The `"mount"` phase is asynchronous** — it fires one microtask after `mountChart()` returns, so a consumer's `onRender` cannot itself throw back into `mountChart()`'s caller. `"resize"`/`"reselect"`/`"restack"` fire synchronously, inside the redraw that caused them. A mount torn down before that microtask runs never fires it at all. `ctx.svg` is always the svg **on screen** when the callback runs: a re-render that lands inside that microtask gap (a title-selector change made immediately after `mountChart()` returns) fires `"reselect"` first, and the `"mount"` call that follows reports the new svg rather than the superseded one. |
| Legend select | `onLegendSelect` | Any chart with a legend. Reports the full active/dimmed series set. | Fires on a pin (click), **and also on hover, focus, blur, and the reset button** — issue #30's own gloss for this is "pin/**dim**", so hover-firing is intended, not a bug. A consumer that only cares about pins should debounce or de-duplicate. |

**All three CustomEvents dispatch unconditionally, whether or not a host callback was passed to
`mountChart`.** A published figure has no host callback to gate on, so this is what lets a page
observe it at all — but it is also a real behavioural change on every categorical-chart hover for
an existing embedder that mounts charts today and has never looked at these events.

#### `tooltipContainer`

`MountOptions.tooltipContainer` reparents the floating tooltip card into a given element instead of
the default `document.body`. Opt-in: the card is positioned `position: fixed` at the cursor's
viewport coordinates, and a container with `overflow: hidden` or a CSS `transform` on it (or an
ancestor) would clip it or throw off that positioning, which `document.body` never does. Pass a
container only when it is known to have neither, and keep it **stable across the mount's
lifetime** — a fresh element passed in on every re-render leaves the previous one's tooltip div
behind, invisible and unreachable.

#### Classes

The coordinated-cursor hover chrome — the shaded band/region a reader sees hovering a bar, stacked
segment, or line-chart point, and its value-pill/axis-label capsules — carries these seven classes,
so a consumer stylesheet can target them without depending on presentation attributes like `rx="3"`
(which two different elements shared before this):

| class | element | drawn on |
|---|---|---|
| `tbl-coord-region` | the shaded band/column `<rect>` | every coordinated-cursor chart type except line and area (any x-axis type), which draw `tbl-coord-guide` instead |
| `tbl-coord-pill` | a value-pill's background `<rect>` | every coordinated-cursor chart type except dumbbell (its coordinated cursor is a pure band echo — no pills) — and on a **waterfall**, its *delta* steps only: a `total` or `skip` step gets the shaded region and the axis-label echo but no pill, because its number is the always-on running-total label rather than a delta. Also draws the legend-hover/pin value pills on bar, stacked-bar, waterfall and dot-plot. `test/hover-surface-matrix.test.ts` records both waterfall steps as separate rows |
| `tbl-coord-pill-text` | a value-pill's `<text>` | same as `tbl-coord-pill` |
| `tbl-coord-axis-label` | the hovered category's echoed axis-label `<rect>` background | every coordinated-cursor chart type except dumbbell and horizontal bar/stacked/waterfall (which bold the existing axis label instead) — the actively-hovered pane only. On **line/area** it is additionally conditional on there being something to draw: absent `tooltip_x_format` the echo mirrors the pane's x-axis tick rows, so a pane spanning less than a month (a temporal axis ticks on whole months) draws no ticks and no echoed label either. Setting `tooltip_x_format` draws it regardless, anchored below the plot where there are no tick rows — and where there are, the tick labels the pill covers carry an inline `visibility: hidden` while it shows, removed when the cursor leaves the pane |
| `tbl-coord-axis-label-text` | that echoed axis label's `<text>` | same as `tbl-coord-axis-label` |
| `tbl-coord-guide` | the vertical guide `<line>` | line charts (any x-axis type) and area charts |
| `tbl-coord-dot` | the hovered point's highlight ring `<circle>` | line charts (any x-axis type), area charts, and dot-plot |

All seven live inside a `g.tbl-coord` wrapper, except `tbl-coord-pill`/`tbl-coord-pill-text`, which
also draw inside a separate `g.tbl-hl-pills` wrapper for the legend-hover/pin pills (same classes,
different group — see `attachHighlightPills`). `chrome.valuePills: false` (see Bar / stacked-bar
options, above) removes `tbl-coord-pill`/`tbl-coord-pill-text` wherever they are drawn — the
bar/stacked-bar band, the legend-gesture pills, and every coordinated-cursor pane's pills, the
hovered pane included. The other five classes are untouched — whichever of the band highlight, the
guide, the hover dots and the axis-label echo a given chart type draws, it still draws, as does the
hit area behind them, matching `chrome.tooltip`'s contract.

#### Two acceptance criteria this deliberately does not ship

Issue #30 also asked for CONFIG-SPEC to publish a **stable-hooks list**, and for a stable hook's
retirement or rename to be called out under an Upgrading heading. Neither is shipped here — this
is a deliberate scope decision ("classes only, no policy"), not an oversight, and it means a future
rework of any hook, event, class, or option named on this page can still break a consumer silently,
the way `.tbl-legend-swatch.is-dot`'s retirement did in 1.11.0.

## `table.yaml`

A table renders from **tidy/long** data: one CSV row per cell, identified by its stub (row) and
header (column) coordinates plus a value. Stub entries nest to form the row hierarchy (all but the
last → row groups; last → the row label). Header entries nest to form the column hierarchy (all but
the last → banner tiers; last → the leaf column). The value column holds a number, a blank, or a
text string.

### Required

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | Table title. |
| `data` | string | Path to the tidy CSV. |
| `stub` | array | Row-nesting columns. Each entry is a CSV column name or `{label: "..."}`; the **last** entry is the row label, earlier ones are nested row groups. |
| `header` | array | Column-nesting CSV column names; the **last** is the leaf column, earlier ones are banner tiers. |
| `value` | string | CSV column holding each cell's value (number, blank, or text). |

### Roles & panes

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pane` | string | Multi-pane: CSV column whose values split the data into vertically stacked sub-tables, each with its own rows **and** column headers. Omit for a single table. |
| `pane_order` | array | Pane render order + inclusion filter. Default: first-seen. |
| `pane_titles` | object | `{ <paneValue>: "Subheading" }` above each pane. Defaults to the pane value. |

### Labels

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `stub_header` | string \| object | Top-left corner label above the row labels. A string applies to all panes; a `{ <paneValue>: label }` map sets it per pane. |
| `column_labels` | object | `{ <leafKey>: "Display label" }` — overrides a leaf column's raw header value. |
| `row_labels` | object | `{ <rowValue>: "Display label" }` — overrides a row label (last stub value). Lets math/markup live in the spec while the CSV keeps short plain keys; `row_order`, `emphasis_rows`, and `format.rows` still key off the raw CSV value. |
| `group_labels` | object | `{ <groupValue>: "Display label" }` — overrides a row-group heading (any non-last stub value); `group_notes` and `format.groups` still key off the raw CSV value. |
| `header_labels` | object | `{ <headerValue>: "Display label" }` — applied to banner tiers above the leaves. |
| `sublabels` | object | `{ <leafKey>: "secondary" }` — a small second line under a column label (e.g. units). |

Leaf columns are keyed by their **full header path**, not just the last-tier value, so a leaf value
that repeats under different banners (e.g. the same metric under two different scenario headers)
renders as distinct columns instead of one column silently swallowing the other. `header_labels`,
`column_labels`, `sublabels`, `column_order`, and the `column_width` map still key off the leaf's
raw last-tier value (the display label an author writes), so authoring is unaffected — a rule keyed
by a repeated leaf value applies to every leaf sharing that value.

### Order

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `row_order` | array | Row render order; unlisted rows follow in first-seen order. **Scoped within each row group** — it orders leaves inside a group, not across groups. |
| `group_order` | array | Render order for row **groups** (the non-last stub tiers). A flat `string[]` orders the first group tier only; a `string[][]` orders each tier independently (index 0 = first tier, index 1 = second, ...). Unlisted values at a level follow first-seen order. Groups are always gathered by stub path regardless of input row order, so a group's rows render contiguously wherever they appear in the source data (e.g. a scenario-major CSV regroups correctly). |
| `column_order` | array | Leaf-column render order; unlisted leaves follow in first-seen order. On a multi-tier header it is **scoped within each header super-group** — it orders the leaf tier inside a super, not across supers. |
| `column_group_order` | array | The column analogue of `group_order`: render order for header **super-groups** (the non-last header tiers). A flat `string[]` orders the first super tier only; a `string[][]` orders each tier independently. Unlisted values follow first-seen order. Super-groups are always gathered by header path regardless of input row order, so each super `<th>` spans its leaves contiguously (`colspan`). |

### Number formats

`format` resolves per cell with precedence **default → column → group → row**. Each rule is a
`FormatRule`:

| FormatRule field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | enum | `number` (default) \| `percent` (×100, adds `%`) \| `currency`. |
| `decimals` | number | Decimal places. |
| `thousands` | boolean | Group thousands with `,`. |
| `prefix` | string | e.g. `"$"`. |
| `suffix` | string | e.g. `"pp"` (a `percent` type already adds `%`). |
| `signColor` | boolean | Color negatives red / positives green for this scope. |

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `format.default` | FormatRule | Applies to all cells. |
| `format.columns` | object | `{ <leafKey>: FormatRule }`. |
| `format.groups` | object | `{ <groupValue>: FormatRule }`. |
| `format.rows` | object | `{ <rowLabel>: FormatRule }`. |
| `sign_color` | boolean | Apply sign coloring to all cells (overridable per `FormatRule.signColor`). |

Non-numeric, non-empty values render verbatim as left-aligned **text cells** (no number
formatting).

### Cells, footnotes & emphasis

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `emphasis_rows` | array | Row labels to render bold/highlighted — styles the **whole row, including the stub** (row label cell), identically in HTML and PNG export. |
| `emphasis_column` | string | CSV column holding a per-cell emphasis flag (`yes`/`1`/`true`). |
| `footnotes` | object | `{ <key>: "text" }` (e.g. `{ a: "revised" }`); rendered as a list below the table. |
| `footnote_column` | string | CSV column holding per-cell footnote keys (space- or comma-separated). |
| `group_notes` | object | `{ <groupValue>: "note" }` — an italic note under a row-group heading. |

### Layout & interactivity

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `stub_width` | number | Fixed px width for the stub (row-label) column. Overrides the computed width. |
| `stub_min_width` | number | Minimum stub width — a floor on the auto-sized width, or (with `stub_wrap`) the width labels wrap toward. |
| `stub_wrap` | boolean | Allow row labels to wrap onto multiple lines so the stub can be narrower than the longest label. Default false. |
| `stub_nowrap` | boolean | Keep row labels on one line (the stub is sized to the longest). Default false. |
| `column_width` | number \| object | Fixed px width for data columns: one number for all, or `{ <leafKey>: px }`. |
| `column_wrap` | boolean \| object | Wrap **body** data cells onto multiple lines within the column width: `true` (all data columns) or `{ <leafKey>: true }` (named ones). Default false. Pair with `column_width` to cap the width — without a cap the column sizes to its natural width and nothing wraps. Column headers are unaffected (use `header_max_lines` / the `\\` break token for those). |
| `header_max_lines` | number | Wrap leaf-column headers to at most N lines. |
| `spanner_rules` | boolean | Draw flanking rules on multi-column banner headers. Default true. |
| `header_tier_rules` | boolean | Draw horizontal rules between header tiers. Default false. |
| `sticky.firstColumn` | boolean | Pin the row-label column during horizontal scroll. |
| `sort` | boolean | Allow interactive column sorting (within row groups). |
| `collapsible.default` | enum | Makes row groups collapsible: a caret on each group header toggles that group's rows (a nested group collapses its whole subtree), plus expand-all/collapse-all controls. Baseline state for every group not named in `expanded`/`collapsed`. Default `"expanded"`. Omit `collapsible` entirely for the current plain (non-interactive) group headers. |
| `collapsible.expanded` | array | Group **values** (raw CSV values, matching `group_labels` keying) open despite a `"collapsed"` default. |
| `collapsible.collapsed` | array | Group values closed despite an `"expanded"` default. Wins over `expanded` when a value appears in both. |

Collapse state survives a resize, and PNG export renders a static snapshot honoring the live
collapse state (or the spec's defaults, when exported without interaction).

### Text

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `subtitle` | string | Below the title. |
| `source` | string | Source line below the table. Supports inline links: `[text](url)` renders the text as a link on screen. **The URL needs an explicit `http://`, `https://` or `mailto:` scheme** — anything else (including a bare `www.` or a relative path) is not a link and renders as the literal characters you typed, silently. Nothing else from Markdown is supported, there is no escape syntax, and any incomplete construct is literal text, so existing lines are untouched. A URL longer than 2048 characters is not a link either — the parser stops looking there, which is what keeps a malformed line from being expensive to parse. In a **PNG export** the link text is underlined but not clickable and the URL is not shown — a raster image cannot carry a link target. |
| `notes` | string \| array | Explanatory note(s). An array is **joined into a single note paragraph** (it does not render one paragraph per entry). Supports inline links: `[text](url)` renders the text as a link on screen. **The URL needs an explicit `http://`, `https://` or `mailto:` scheme** — anything else (including a bare `www.` or a relative path) is not a link and renders as the literal characters you typed, silently. Nothing else from Markdown is supported, there is no escape syntax, and any incomplete construct is literal text, so existing lines are untouched. A URL longer than 2048 characters is not a link either — the parser stops looking there, which is what keeps a malformed line from being expensive to parse. In a **PNG export** the link text is underlined but not clickable and the URL is not shown — a raster image cannot carry a link target. |

### Inline math & special characters

Any table text — cell values, row/column labels, headers, sublabels, group labels & notes, the
stub-header corner — may contain inline math using the **same MathJax delimiters as the TBL
website**:

- `\( … \)` — inline math (also `\[ … \]` and `$$ … $$`).
- `\$` — a literal dollar sign.
- `\\` — a **hard line break** (anywhere text renders: cells, row/column labels, headers, group
  labels & notes). It splits the text onto a new line at that exact point, and it works even in a
  one-line (`stub_nowrap` / non-wrapping) cell — a break forces two lines there without turning on
  general wrapping. Recognized only **outside** a math delimiter: `\\(` reads as a break then a
  literal `(`. Leading/trailing/consecutive `\\` produce empty lines.
- Bare `$`, `_`, `^`, `*` are **only** special inside a delimiter, so ordinary text (including
  currency like `$2.50`) needs no escaping and renders unchanged.

> **YAML/CSV escaping for `\\`.** In **CSV** (row/stub labels) there is no escaping, so `\\` is two
> literal characters and works directly. In **double-quoted YAML** `\\` collapses to a single
> backslash — use **single-quoted** YAML (`'Line one \\ line two'`) or write `\\\\`. This mirrors
> the existing inline-math YAML gotcha.

Inside a delimiter, the supported **linear** subset of LaTeX is:

| Feature | Syntax | Example → render |
|---|---|---|
| Greek letters | `\sigma`, `\theta`, `\Sigma`, … | `\(\sigma\)` → σ |
| Subscript | `_{…}` / `_x` | `\(r_{ai}\)` → r with subscript *ai* |
| Superscript | `^{…}` / `^x` | `\(x^2\)` → x² |
| Stacked sub+super | `_{}^{}` on one base | `\(\theta_1^K\)` → θ with K above, 1 below |
| Inline italic | `\textit{…}` / `\mathit{…}` | `\(\textit{abc}\)` → *abc* |
| Operators / relations | `\cdot \times \leq \geq \approx \pm \sum \int …` | `\(\sigma \leq 1\)` → σ ≤ 1 |

Latin letters and lowercase Greek render italic (math variables); digits, uppercase Greek, and symbols upright.

**Not supported:** two-dimensional constructs — `\frac`, `\sqrt`, matrices, `\binom`, over/under
braces. These are **rejected at validation** with a clear message (they are never silently
mis-rendered). For displayed equations needing them, use a real MathJax block on the page.

## Series textures

`series_patterns` gives a series a hatch **in addition to** its color, so color, lightness and
texture are three independent things a fill can say. The color the mark is actually painted stays
the pattern's **ground**, so adding a texture does not change the series' color.

The six values are matplotlib's hatch characters, and each is a picture of its own result:

| value | renders |
|---|---|
| `"/"` | diagonal lines, ascending left→right |
| `"\\"` | diagonal lines, descending left→right |
| `"\|"` | vertical lines |
| `"-"` | horizontal lines |
| `"+"` | vertical and horizontal, crossed |
| `"x"` | both diagonals, crossed |

```yaml
series_colors:
  collectedNew: blue
  lostToBehavior: "#58A3E7"
series_patterns:
  lostToBehavior: "/"
```

**Always quote the value.** Bare `-` is a YAML sequence indicator and bare `|` a block-scalar
indicator; `/` and `\` are safest quoted too.

Notes:

- **An unrecognized value is rejected at load**, never rendered flat. Density repeats (`"//"`) are
  deliberately unsupported: more ink per unit area reads as a darker shade, which is what the tonal
  scale already controls precisely through `series_colors`.
- The texture reaches the chart, the legend key, the **PNG export** — the export re-renders from the
  spec, so a texture applied by a consumer's stylesheet would not — and the hover tooltip **on the
  chart types that draw one**. That last clause is narrow: textures are restricted to the filled
  types (`bar`, `stacked`, `area`, `histogram`, `waterfall`), and of those only standalone `area`,
  standalone `histogram` and a stacked chart with a net dot hover with a card at default settings.
  `bar` and `waterfall` never do, and no coordinated small-multiples pane does; there the texture
  reaches the marks and the legend, and the hover shows in-place value pills with no key to texture.
- **Every filled chart type keys with a square chip**, textured or not — `bar`, `stacked`, `area`,
  `histogram`, `waterfall`. `area` moved to a chip in 1.11.0: an area is a filled region, so a line
  swatch misrepresented it, and a 3px line cannot hold the glyph. The **line swatch** is now
  `chartType: line` alone; the point types key with their own marks instead — `scatter` and
  `dotplot` with the series' symbol (or a rounded colour chip when `columns.shape` is a separate
  channel), `dumbbell` with its dot or ring.
- **Histogram bars draw at `fill-opacity: 0.5`** — every histogram, single- and multi-series alike,
  because a solid bin reads too heavy and the transparency is what lets overlapping series blend.
  A texture inherits it, so ground and band are both muted, exactly as a flat fill is. On a
  multi-series histogram the texture still separates the series where they overlap, which is the
  point, but judge it on your own data: a texture cannot rescue a mark whose colour is already
  translucent.
- A legend/tooltip key draws **one centred instance** of the texture in a 14px square — a *glyph*,
  not a patch of the chart's tiling. `"/"` reads as three bands (ground, mark, ground), `"+"` as a
  plus, `"x"` as an x. A tiled key can only show a fraction of one period at that size, which is an
  edge with no direction in it. `test/hatch-glyph.test.ts` locks the coordinates;
  `test/hatch-legend-legibility.test.ts` rasterises the real legend and measures all six from their
  pixels.
- The geometry is deliberately **coarse** — a 16px period with a 7px band, so the ground and the
  hatch read as two colors banded together rather than as pinstripes over a color. The crossed
  characters (`"+"`, `"x"`) use a thinner 4px line, because crossing two directions overlaps
  their ink; that puts all six characters at the same ~44% coverage, so they differ only in
  **direction**, never in weight.
- **The band color is derived, not authored.** You supply the base color and the character; the
  engine resolves the band as **three tonal tiers** along that color's own hue ramp — darker
  normally, lighter when the ground is too dark to darken. That keeps every pair inside one hue
  family and on the Style-Guide ramp. `test/hatch.test.ts` gates the result across all **72**
  hue-family colors an author can name (8 tiers × 7 families, the 7 bases and their `-light`
  variants, plus `navy` and `sky`), holding every pair **between 20 and 33 ΔL\***; measured today
  they run 21.6 (`red-50`) to 32.5 (`sky`). `navy` and `sky` borrow blue's ramp; a raw `"#hex"` off
  every ramp gets an equivalent 28 L\* step instead.
- **The ground is whatever the mark is PAINTED, not its `series_colors` entry.** `bar_color`,
  `category_colors`, `highlightSeries` dimming and the title-selector accent each override a fill
  without going through the series color map, and each becomes the ground of the texture laid over
  it — so an amber `bar_color` bar hatches amber, a `category_colors` "Total" bar gets its own
  pattern in its own color rather than the rest of the series', and a dimmed series hatches grey.
  The band is then derived from that color, so the pair stays on the ramp the ground sits on. The
  **chart, the legend key, the hover tooltip and the PNG export** all draw the texture the chart
  resolved while painting the mark — one resolved texture, handed to the other three, not four
  derivations that have to match — so none of them can show a texture on a ground the chart does not
  paint. (The tooltip is in that list only where the chart type draws a tooltip at all; see the
  note above.) Where a series' marks are painted over more than one ground (`category_colors`), the
  tooltip re-grounds per hovered mark and the legend row, which names a series rather than a mark,
  keys the first.
- **A small-multiples figure has ONE legend over N panes**, so its key takes the texture a pane
  actually painted (the first pane that paints the series, so a series the first pane lacks is still
  keyed) rather than re-deriving one. A series is assigned its color once for the whole figure, so
  every pane paints it the same ground and there is only one ground to take. Where a pane draws a
  **tooltip** of its own, it keys from that pane — which among the texturable types means a stacked
  pane with a net dot; every other filled type's pane hovers with the coordinated cursor and has no
  key to texture.
- **The color under a texture must be one the engine can read** — a palette name or a `"#hex"`.
  Since the band is derived from the ground's own lightness, a string whose lightness cannot be read
  would leave the band equal to the ground, i.e. a flat block where a texture was asked for. Neither
  half of that reaches a published chart. A name the engine cannot paint at all (a typo like
  `blue-450`) fails **validation**, texture or no texture. A string it can paint but cannot measure
  also fails validation, but only where a texture is laid over it: `currentColor`, `none`, a CSS
  `var(--…)` or `url(…)`, the modern color functions (`oklch`, `oklab`, `lab`, `lch`, `hwb`, `color`,
  `color-mix`), and the SPACE-separated function forms (`rgb(0 114 178)` — the comma form
  `rgb(0,114,178)` reads fine). Paint one of those without a texture and it renders; ask for a
  texture over it and the load fails naming the series, because the alternative was a crash at render.
- Coarse bands need room: a segment much under ~30px along the stacking axis shows less than
  two full periods and reads as a partial band rather than a texture.
- **With `barStack.mono`, a texture borrows a neighbour's shade.** A mono stack spends consecutive
  tiers of one ramp on the segments themselves, and a band is three tiers from its ground — so a
  textured segment's band is exactly the color of the segment three places along the stack. It is
  still a legible pair, but the texture stops reading as a channel independent of the shade.
  Texture **one** segment of a mono stack rather than several.

## Colors

Anywhere a color is accepted (`series_colors`, annotation `color`, `barStack.mono.base`, …), the
value is either a **named color** or a raw `"#hex"`:

- **Categorical hues:** `blue`, `amber`, `violet`, `green`, `red`, `rose`, `russet` — and a
  `-light` variant of each (e.g. `blue-light`).
- **Tonal tiers:** `<hue>-<tier>` for tiers `50 100 200 300 400 500 600 700`, lightest to darkest
  (e.g. `blue-200`, `violet-700`). Through the middle of the ramp the tiers are near-iso-lightness
  across hues — tiers 200–500 spread only ~1 L\*, so `blue-200` and `amber-200` are equally light,
  which is what makes a tier the right way to relate two series in one hue family. The extremes
  drift: tier 50 spreads 7.8 L\* across the seven hues and tier 700 spreads 5.8, so two series
  related at `-50` or `-700` will not read as equally light.
- **Aliases:** `purple`→violet, `pink`→rose, `yellow`→amber, `brown`→russet — each with `-light`
  and each with the full tier set (`purple-600` = `violet-600`).
- **Neutrals and brand:** `black`, `grey` (`gray`), `navy`, `sky`.

Any **CSS color** passes through unchanged, so a raw `"#1A1A2E"`, an `rgb(…)`, or a CSS keyword like
`steelblue` works too.

A value that is **neither** a palette name **nor** a CSS color is **rejected at load**. It is not a
cosmetic slip: an unresolvable string reaches Plot as a constant fill, Plot reads a string it cannot
parse as a *column name*, and the marks it colored are dropped — so a one-character typo
(`blue-450`, `sky-300`, `blu`) used to publish a chart frame with nothing drawn in it. The error
names the field, the value, and the near miss.

`barStack.mono.base` accepts only the 7 categorical hues (or an alias) — it pulls that hue's tonal
scale, so a hex has no scale to pull and is rejected too.

## CSV format

**Charts** use long format. Columns are named freely and mapped via `columns:`; absent that block,
the engine expects `time`, `series`, `value`.

| role | content |
|---|---|
| x (`time`) | x-value. Must parse per `xAxisType`: integer for `numeric`, `YYYY-MM-DD` for `temporal`, `YYYYQ#` for `quarterly`, any string for `categorical`. |
| series | Series identifier; each distinct value is a separate line/segment/band. Omit the column for a single-series chart. |
| value | Numeric y-value. May be empty for missing observations. |

Optional chart columns: confidence-bound columns (if `confidence_bands` references them), the facet
column (if `columns.facet` is set), the shape column (if `columns.shape` is set), the point-label
column (if `columns.point_label` is set), and the section column (if `columns.section` is set).

**Tables** also use tidy/long data: one row per cell, with the `stub`, `header`, and `value`
columns (plus optional `pane`, `emphasis_column`, `footnote_column`). The `value` column may hold
numbers, blanks, or text strings.

Validation parses every row and fails on malformed x-values, missing required columns, or
referenced keys that don't appear in the data.

## Minimal examples

**Single-series line:**

```yaml
chartType: line
title: "Median hours worked"
xAxisType: temporal
data: data.csv
# columns omitted → time / value, no series
```

**Stacked area with annotations:**

```yaml
chartType: area
title: "Effective tariff rate by authority"
subtitle: "Percent"
xAxisType: temporal
series_order: [Base Rate, Section 301, Section 232]
annotations:
  xAxis:
    - { x: "2025-04-02", label: "April 2 announcement" }
  bands:
    - { start: "2026-04-01", end: "2026-12-31", label: "Assumes no further changes" }
  points:
    - { x: "2025-04-11", series: Section 232, label: "Peak", connector: true, dx: -16 }
data: data.csv
```

**Table:**

```yaml
title: "Budget score"
data: data.csv
stub: [proposal, { label: method }]   # proposal → row group, method → row label
header: [period]                       # one leaf column per period value
value: value
format:
  default: { type: currency, decimals: 1, prefix: "$" }
sticky: { firstColumn: true }
source: "The Budget Lab"
```
